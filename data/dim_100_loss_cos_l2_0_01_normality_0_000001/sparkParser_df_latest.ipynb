       "[['The fifteen relators in this original mandamus proceeding are defendants in a seven-year-old mass-tort suit involving 448 plaintiffs.[1] Relators seek relief from the trial court\\'s orders abating almost all discovery and allowing the plaintiffs\\' counsel to pick which plaintiffs\\' claims will be tried first. Many of the relators and other defendants who have since settled sought the same relief more than three years ago in mandamus petitions first to the court of appeals, which denied relief without opinion,[2] and then to this Court. We denied relief \"without prejudice\" to give the trial court \"the opportunity to reconsider the abatement order\"[3] in light of our then-recent opinion in In re Colonial Pipeline Co.[4] Relators immediately moved the trial court for such reconsideration, but after the trial court delayed ruling on their motion for a year, relators again petitioned the court of appeals for mandamus relief. While relators\\' petition was pending there, the trial court denied relators\\' motion. The court of appeals conditionally granted partial relief,[5] and relators have now returned here. We grant additional relief.',\n",
       "  'The underlying litigation was filed on August 25, 1994, by 454 plaintiffs (a few of whose claims have since been dismissed) who had worked at the Parker-Hannifin Corporation\\'s O-ring seal manufacturing facility in McAllen. They alleged that they had suffered personal injuries from exposure to what they called a \"toxic soup\" of chemicals in the plant environment, chemicals they claimed were made by or supplied to the plant by the 55 defendants originally named in the suit. After the case was removed to federal court and remanded, the defendants requested discovery from the plaintiffs by various means, most of which the plaintiffs simply ignored. Eventually, most of the plaintiffs produced some information regarding their claimed injuries and the possibly causative chemicals, but almost none of the information was specific enough to be meaningful. For example, in response to the following interrogatory\\x97',\n",
       "  \"Please state the name and address of each and every doctor, physician or other medical practitioner who has attributed your alleged injury made the basis of this lawsuit to exposure to the defendants' products, including the dates of treatment or examination of each such doctor, physician or other medical practitioner, and the name or identity of the product to which your alleged injury is attributed.\",\n",
       "  '\\x97the plaintiffs uniformly answered they did not recall. When the defendants sought to depose the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs moved to try a few of the claims first and restrict discovery to them. On November *199 20, 1997, the trial court ordered the plaintiffs\\' counsel to select twenty plaintiffs to go to trial and limited discovery to them, to persons designated by them as having knowledge of relevant facts, and to non-parties. The court also permitted the defendants to take additional depositions on a showing of \"particularized need\", which it did not define. When the defendants attempted to obtain discovery from non-parties unrelated to the twenty designated plaintiffs, the court on December 23, 1997, ordered that all discovery, whether from parties or non-parties, be limited to the twenty designated plaintiffs.',\n",
       "  \"The defendants petitioned for relief from these orders, and while their petition was pending in this Court, we held in In re Colonial Pipeline Co. that a similar abatement of discovery was a clear abuse of discretion.[6] There, over three thousand plaintiffs sued three defendants alleging that they had been injured when four pipelines ruptured releasing hazardous substances.[7] Concerning the trial court's nearly complete abatement of discovery, we wrote:\",\n",
       "  'In this case, relators are precluded from obtaining even the most basic information from 3,265 plaintiffs until after the claims of the initial trial group of ten are resolved. Given that three and a half years have already passed since the incident underlying this case occurred, it could be many months or even years before any discovery is available. Unfortunately but inevitably, memories fade with time and evidence may be lost or corrupted. Documents may be destroyed in compliance with document retention programs. More importantly, there were four different pipelines with different substances involved. Certain illnesses or damage may conceivably be attributable to one but not all of the substances involved. The defendants have not been provided, among other things, with descriptions of the plaintiffs\\' alleged injuries, the names of treating physicians, or the names of the substances that caused the alleged injuries. Without discovery of basic medical information from all the plaintiffs, each defendant is put in the position of preparing to defend itself against claims that may not involve the substance that was contained in its pipeline. While we encourage trial courts to manage litigation actively, to try test cases to establish benchmark results, and to prohibit needless or repetitive discovery in thousands of cases that might never be tried, \"[e]ach defendant is entitled to discover whether there has been a medical determination that an illness has been caused by that defendant\\'s product.\" [Able Supply Co. v.] Moye, 898 S.W.2d [766,] 770 [(Tex.1995)]. We therefore conclude that the trial court\\'s order abating all discovery from such a large group of parties constitutes an abuse of discretion.[8]',\n",
       "  \"Rather than review the similar abatement of discovery in this case, which was ordered without benefit of our views in Colonial Pipeline, we denied relators' petition for mandamus to allow the trial court to reconsider its rulings.[9] On October 23, 1998, eight days after our opinion issued, relators moved the trial court for such reconsideration. The court held several hearings on that motion and others that were filed, and allowed the plaintiffs' counsel *200 to designate a new group of twenty-five plaintiffs to go to trial, only one of whom was included in the first twenty. But the court did not rule on relators' motion for reconsideration despite relators' multiple requests that it do so.\",\n",
       "  \"Nearly a year passed, and relators again sought relief by mandamus. At oral argument in the court of appeals, relators' counsel was handed the trial court's November 4, 1999 order denying the motion to reconsider. The order recited that defendants had been afforded more discovery than the defendants in Colonial Pipeline, and that additional discovery could delay trial\\x97which, of course, had already been delayed five years with almost no discovery. The court of appeals concluded that the trial court had clearly abused its discretion by refusing to require the plaintiffs to answer the interrogatory quoted above, which requested essentially the same information that we required the plaintiffs to provide in Moye and Colonial Pipeline.[10] But the court of appeals refused to direct the trial court to permit any further discovery, concluding:\",\n",
       "  'We do not believe the supreme court in Colonial Pipeline intended to prohibit trial courts from selecting small groups of trial plaintiffs to serve as test cases while abating discovery as to the remaining plaintiffs in order to manage mass tort cases. Indeed, the supreme court has previously recognized the importance of allowing trial courts to manage their own dockets in such a manner. See Polaris Inv. Management Corp. v. Abascal, 892 S.W.2d 860, 861 (Tex.1995).[11]',\n",
       "  \"The court of appeals refused to disturb the trial court's orders abating other discovery and allowing the plaintiffs' counsel to pick claims to go to trial without judicial oversight or meaningful input from the defendants.[12]\",\n",
       "  \"Relators here argue that the trial court has simply refused to follow our decision in Colonial Pipeline and has unduly delayed reconsidering its orders as we requested. We agree. Neither the trial court, nor the plaintiffs as the real parties in interest, have suggested any basis for this delay. Furthermore, as the court of appeals concluded, the plaintiffs have failed to show why after seven years of litigation they should not be required to provide the same basic information regarding their individual injuries and the causative chemicals that we required in Moye and Colonial Pipeline. But in refusing to direct the trial court to permit additional discovery, the court of appeals misread our opinion in Polaris. There we held that a trial court's abatement of discovery for seven months in a mass-tort case would not be reviewed by petition for mandamus.[13] Nothing in our opinion suggests that an improper abatement of discovery can never be reviewed, even after seven years. While it is certainly true that a trial court must be given latitude in managing discovery and preparing a case for trial, especially a case as complex as this, that latitude is not unbounded. Here, as in Colonial Pipeline, the parties now face the very real threat that after seven years evidence will be destroyed, witnesses will die or disappear, and memories will be impaired. A blanket abatement of discovery cannot be justified by the goal of an orderly trial process when not one plaintiff has yet gone to trial. To abate discovery for years *201 without justification is a clear abuse of discretion.\",\n",
       "  'Furthermore, in denying relators relief from the trial court\\'s order allowing the plaintiffs\\' counsel to select the claims to be tried first, the court of appeals failed to follow our opinions in In re Ethyl Corp.[14] and In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.[15] In those cases we recognized that in mass-tort cases the plaintiffs\\' claims may be tried a few at a time, but we set out factors for trial courts to consider in determining what claims to consolidate for trial, including: whether the plaintiffs to be tried together worked in the same place, at similar jobs, during similar time periods; whether their diseases or injuries are or were similar, and they are living or deceased; whether they are represented by the same counsel; and the status of discovery.[16] Another consideration is the maturity of the tort.[17] We admonished trial courts to be \"very cautious both in choosing the cases that are initially set and in proceeding with the actual trial to ensure that the process remains fair to all.\"[18] In the present case, the trial court did not consider the factors we prescribed; indeed, it could not have done so because it has prevented much of the information pertinent to those factors from being adduced through discovery. While its order permitted the defendants to object to the plaintiffs selected for trial, their bases for doing so have been restricted by their limited access to discovery. To abate meaningful discovery and allow the plaintiffs\\' counsel to select what claims will be tried, as the trial court has done, is not a process \"fair to all\".',\n",
       "  'As in Colonial Pipeline, the trial court\\'s discovery order denies defendants \"discovery that goes to the heart of the litigation.\"[19] Moreover, the continued abatement of the discovery process after seven years of litigation threatens that evidence critical to the claims made will become unavailable before discovery can be conducted. For these reasons we conclude as we did in Colonial Pipeline that relators do not have an adequate remedy by appeal.[20]',\n",
       "  \"To avoid further delay, we direct the trial court to: vacate its orders of November 20, 1997, December 23, 1997, and November 4, 1999, within five days of the date of this opinion; permit relators to proceed with discovery from the plaintiffs under the Rules of Civil Procedure without delay; and determine, after adequate discovery, following the procedures we have laid out in Ethyl and Bristol-Myers, how the plaintiffs' claims should proceed to trial. The writ will issue only if the trial court fails to comply. Tex.R.App. P. 59.1.\"],\n",
       " [\"This case requires us to decide whether a party can maintain a claim based on either fraud or fraudulent inducement when that claim is premised on a contract that the Statute of Frauds makes unenforceable. We hold that a plaintiff cannot assert a fraudulent inducement claim in the absence of a contract. We further hold that under the facts of this case, to the extent that Glazner seeks to recover the benefit-of-the-bargain damages related to a contract that is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, the Statute bars the fraud claim, but that Glazner's fraud claim for out-of-pocket damages, if any, may survive the Statute of Frauds. We therefore affirm the court of appeals' judgment in part, reverse in part, and render judgment that Glazner take nothing on his fraudulent inducement claim and on his fraud claim to the extent that he seeks benefit-of-the-bargain damages.\",\n",
       "  'Petitioner R.E. Haase owns the Whataburger franchise rights for the City of Longview. In 1992, respondent Joseph K. Glazner went to work for Haase as a manager trainee. By the end of 1992, Glazner had been promoted to supervisor for Haase\\'s five Longview Whataburger restaurants. Glazner alleges that in 1994, he and Haase entered into a contract in which Haase agreed to allow Glazner to build an additional Whataburger in south Longview, in Haase\\'s franchise area. According to Glazner, Haase promised to help Glazner secure a franchise by guaranteeing the success of Glazner\\'s proposed new restaurant to Whataburger Inc., the corporate franchisor. Glazner further claims that Haase agreed to sell Glazner his restaurants when Haase decided to retire, and that Glazner agreed to sell Haase his proposed restaurant should he ever decide to sell \"for some reason.\" Glazner asserts that the consideration to Haase for this agreement was to be two percent of the net sales from Glazner\\'s new restaurant. Glazner argues that the contract\\'s terms appear in three letters to Whataburger either signed by Haase or incorporated by reference in a letter that Haase signed, along with a proposed cash-flow statement Glazner prepared assuming a payment to Haase of two percent of projected net sales.',\n",
       "  'In May 1995, Glazner quit working for Haase. He never obtained a Whataburger franchise. The record shows that Whataburger did not grant any new franchises during the time that Glazner worked for Haase. In November 1996, Haase was granted a Whataburger franchise for a south Longview location. He opened a restaurant there in June 1997.',\n",
       "  \"Glazner sued Haase, alleging breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent inducement, and unjust enrichment. Glazner named as defendants both Haase and PRH Investments, Inc., a corporation that Haase and his wife formed, alleging that Haase and PRH were jointly and severally liable and that the corporate veil should be pierced *797 because Haase had not observed appropriate corporate formalities. Haase moved for summary judgment on the following grounds: 1) the alleged contract is unenforceable because of the Statute of Frauds;[1] 2) the Statute of Frauds bars Glazner's fraud claims; 3) Glazner offered no evidence of a valid contract; 4) there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment; and 5) Glazner offered no evidence to support piercing the corporate veil. The trial court granted summary judgment without specifying the grounds for its decision.\",\n",
       "  \"Glazner appealed. The court of appeals upheld the summary judgment on all claims except those for fraud and fraudulent inducement. With respect to the breach of contract claim, the court of appeals noted that there was no dispute that the Statute of Frauds applied to the alleged contract because it was both a promise to answer for another's debt and an agreement that could not be performed within one year.[2] The Court concluded that no writing existed that satisfied the Statute.[3] Moreover, the court reasoned, the agreement did not satisfy the Statute of Frauds because it was not final.[4] Rather, the letters Glazner relied on showed ongoing negotiations, not a binding agreement.[5] Thus, the court of appeals affirmed summary judgment on the breach of contract claim because there was no enforceable contract. Glazner does not challenge that ruling.\",\n",
       "  \"The court of appeals further held that the Statute of Frauds does not bar Glazner's claims for fraud and fraudulent inducement because of this Court's opinion in Formosa Plastics Corporation USA v. Presidio Engineers and Contractors, Inc.[6] Citing Formosa Plastics, the court reasoned that Glazner's fraud and fraudulent inducement claims alleged a breach of legal duties completely independent of those under the alleged contract.[7] Thus, the court of appeals determined that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on those claims and remanded them to the trial court.[8]\",\n",
       "  \"We granted Haase's petition for review. He asserts that the court of appeals erred by permitting Glazner to assert a fraudulent inducement claim when there is no contract, and by holding that the Statute of Frauds does not bar Glazner's fraud claim because of Formosa Plastics. When reviewing a summary judgment under Rule 166a(c), we consider whether the successful movant in the trial court carried its burden to show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that judgment should be granted as a matter of law.[9] We take all evidence favorable to the nonmovant as true, and we make all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor.[10]\",\n",
       "  \"We first consider Haase's contention that the court of appeals erred in concluding that Glazner may assert a fraudulent inducement claim in the absence of a contract. Haase argues that by *798 its nature a fraudulent inducement claim presupposes that a party has been induced to enter a contract. When a party has not been induced into a contract, he asserts, there is no detrimental reliance and therefore no fraudulent inducement claim. We agree.\",\n",
       "  'As we observed in Formosa Plastics, \"Texas law has long imposed a duty to abstain from inducing another to enter into a contract through the use of fraudulent misrepresentations.\"[11] Certainly there can be no breach of that duty when one is not induced into a contract. More significantly, proof that a party relied to its detriment on an alleged misrepresentation is an essential element of a fraud claim.[12] Without a binding agreement, there is no detrimental reliance, and thus no fraudulent inducement claim. That is, when a party has not incurred a contractual obligation, it has not been induced to do anything. At least two courts of appeals have previously reached this conclusion.[13]',\n",
       "  \"Here, the court of appeals concluded that the parties never reached a final agreement; rather, the letters that make up the alleged contract simply evidence ongoing negotiations.[14] Glazner does not challenge this conclusion before us, and it is fatal to his fraudulent inducement claim. Thus, the court of appeals erred when it reversed the summary judgment on Glazner's fraudulent inducement claim.\",\n",
       "  \"We next consider Haase's argument that the court of appeals erred in holding that the Statute of Frauds does not bar Glazner's fraud claim because of Formosa Plastics. Haase relies on several opinions from the courts of appeals holding that the Statute of Frauds bars a fraud claim when, as here, the plaintiff seeks to obtain the benefit of an otherwise unenforceable bargain.[15] Glazner counters that Formosa Plastics reaffirmed that tort damages for fraud can be recovered even where the plaintiff suffers only economic loss related to the contract's subject matter.[16] Again, we agree with Haase.\",\n",
       "  \"In Formosa Plastics, we concluded that Presidio could bring a fraudulent inducement claim even though its damages consisted only of economic losses related to the performance and subject matter of the parties' contract.[17] Some of our language in that opinion suggests that there is no distinction between a claim for fraud and one for fraudulent inducement.[18] Fraudulent inducement, however, is a particular species of fraud that arises only in the context of a contract and requires the existence of a contract as part of its proof. That is, with a fraudulent inducement claim, the elements of fraud must be established *799 as they relate to an agreement between the parties. Formosa Plastics involved a fraudulent inducement claim based on representations contained in the bid packet upon which Presidio based its contract offer, which resulted in a written contract between the parties. Thus, the case was correctly decided as to fraudulent inducement. Although economic losses may be recoverable under either fraud or fraudulent inducement, Formosa Plastics should not be construed to say that fraud and fraudulent inducement are interchangeable with respect to the measure of damages that would be recoverable.\",\n",
       "  \"Moreover, nothing in Formosa Plastics prevents the Statute of Frauds from precluding a fraud claim that seeks to recover the benefit of an unenforceable bargain. The Statute simply was not an issue in that case\\x97neither party argued that the Statute of Frauds had anything to do with enforcing the parties' contract. As a result, in Formosa Plastics we had no occasion to consider the Statute of Frauds' effect on a fraud claim premised on an unenforceable contract.\",\n",
       "  'This Court did, however, consider that question in Nagle v. Nagle.[19] In that case, the plaintiff sued her former husband to enforce his oral promise to convey to her his half-interest in their home. She alleged fraud and sought specific performance or damages from his failure to perform. The jury found for the plaintiff, and the court of appeals affirmed. This Court reversed, because enforcing an oral promise to convey land despite the Statute of Frauds would render the statute meaningless.[20]',\n",
       "  \"That same reasoning holds true here. If in the face of the Statute of Frauds we permit Glazner's fraud claim to the extent he seeks to recover the benefit of the unenforceable bargain, we deprive the Statute of any effect. The Statute exists to prevent fraud and perjury in certain kinds of transactions by requiring agreements to be set out in a writing signed by the parties.[21] But that purpose is frustrated and the Statute easily circumvented if a party can use a fraud claim essentially to enforce a contract the Statute makes unenforceable. We therefore hold that the Statute of Frauds bars a fraud claim to the extent the plaintiff seeks to recover as damages the benefit of a bargain that cannot otherwise be enforced because it fails to comply with the Statute of Frauds.\",\n",
       "  'But Glazner\\'s fraud claim may not contravene the Statute of Frauds to the extent that he seeks out-of-pocket damages incurred in relying upon Haase\\'s alleged misrepresentations.[22] With respect to such damages, Glazner is not attempting to enforce the otherwise unenforceable contract. Relying on Glazner\\'s deposition testimony, Haase argues that Glazner\\'s only alleged damages are the lost profits from the franchise he never secured. But Glazner\\'s petition is not so limited. Rather, Glazner\\'s petition alleges that he made *800 \"efforts concerning demographics, decor, potential profits, and location.\" And the summary judgment record reveals that Glazner hired a surveyor and entered into an earnest-money contract for a site on which he proposed to build his restaurant. These kinds of damages are not part of the benefit of any alleged bargain between the parties.',\n",
       "  \"Haase did not move for summary judgment on the grounds that there was no evidence of damages aside from lost profits.[23] Nor did he move for summary judgment on the grounds that there was no evidence of reasonable reliance. Consequently, under the circumstances presented here, Glazner's fraud claim may survive Haase's motion for summary judgment to the extent that he seeks to recover these kinds of out-of-pocket damages.\",\n",
       "  \"Haase points out that the trial court granted his special exceptions to Glazner's petition and ordered Glazner to replead, specifically stating the maximum amount of damages claimed, the factual basis underlying the alleged material misrepresentations, and the factual and legal basis underlying Haase's alleged common-law and statutory fraud. Glazner never did. Haase asserts that Glazner's failure to replead is grounds for upholding the summary judgment on both the fraud and fraudulent inducement claims, citing our opinion in Friesenhahn v. Ryan.[24] While Haase is correct that summary judgment may be granted when a party is ordered to replead and fails to,[25] we again note that Haase did not move for summary judgment on this ground. We therefore cannot uphold the summary judgment on that basis.[26]\",\n",
       "  \"In sum, we hold that a plaintiff cannot assert a fraudulent inducement claim when there is no contract. We further hold that under the facts of this case, to the extent that Glazner seeks to recover the benefit-of-the-bargain damages related to a contract that is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, the Statute bars the fraud claim, but that Glazner's fraud claim for out-of-pocket damages, if any, may survive the Statute of Frauds. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment insofar as it remands Glazner's fraudulent inducement claim and his fraud claim for benefit-of-the-bargain damages, and render judgment that Glazner take nothing on those claims. We otherwise affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\"],\n",

In that context, there are two categories of premises defect cases: (1) defects existing on the premises when the independent contractor entered; and (2) defects the independent contractor created by its work activity. Coastal Marine Serv. of Tex., Inc. v. Lawrence, 988 S.W.2d 223, 225 (Tex.1999). Bright argues that Dow is subject to liability under the second category\\x97when the dangerous condition arises because of the independent contractor\\'s work activity.',\n",
       "  'Under this second category, the premises owner generally owes no duty to the independent contractor\\'s employees. In Redinger, we recognized that the \"general rule is that an owner or occupier does not have a duty to see that an independent contractor performs work in a safe manner.... However, when the general contractor exercises some control over a subcontractor\\'s work he may be liable unless he exercises reasonable care in supervising the subcontractor\\'s activity.\" Redinger, 689 S.W.2d at 418.

       "  'In support of his argument that Dow retained actual control, Bright relies first upon the fact that Dow could have stopped Bright\\'s work had it known of the safety hazard. However, as the Restatement (Second) of Torts states, it is not enough that the premises owner has merely a general right to order the work *608 stopped. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 414 cmt. c (1965). To hold otherwise would deter general contractors from setting even minimal safety standards. See Hoechst-Celanese, 967 S.W.2d at 358. As we stated in Hoechst-Celanese, \"`[w]e do not believe that a general contractor or an employer is required to stand idly by while another is injured or killed in order to avoid liability.

Bright argues that Dow's representative should have thoroughly inspected Gulf States' work area prior to issuing the safe work permit. Bright argues that, had an on-site inspection been properly performed, Dow's safety representative could have detected that the pipe placed by Bright's fellow Gulf States' employee was not adequately secured.\",\n",
       "  'We rejected a similar argument in Koch Refining Co. v. Chapa. The injured employee in Koch argued that a duty was established based on the presence of a Koch safety representative and the possibility that he might intervene and forbid the employee from lifting a pipe in a dangerous manner. In addition, the employee in Koch argued that Koch owed a duty because Koch safety representatives had allegedly instructed the independent contractor\\'s employees in the past to perform their work in a safer manner. However, we concluded that such testimony was not evidence that Koch exercised the degree of control necessary to create a duty. We held that \"Koch at most owed [the independent contractor\\'s] employees `a duty that any safety requirements and procedures it promulgated did not unreasonably increase, rather than decrease, the probability and severity of injury.\\'\" Koch, 11 S.W.3d at 156 (quoting Hoechst-Celanese, 967 S.W.2d at 358). Further, we stated in Koch that the mere fact that a Koch safety employee was present to tell its independent contractor\\'s employees if they were doing \"something wrong\" and to remind them to do the job in a safe manner was insufficient to establish actual control. Koch, 11 S.W.3d at 156. We stated that the above is not evidence that the independent contractor and its employee were not free to do their work in their own way and is not evidence that Koch controlled the method of work or its operative details. Id.',\n",
       "  \"In this case, Gulf States and Dow both had safety representatives at the work site. Gulf States knew, because of its acceptance of the Construction Contract, that it was responsible for Bright's safety and the safety of other Gulf States' employees. Accordingly, any argument that the presence of the Dow safety representative caused Bright and Gulf States to lower their safety consciousness is misplaced. Further, Dow's safe work permit system does not alter our analysis. The fact that Dow implemented a safe work permit system as an attempt at creating a safer construction site did not unreasonably increase the probability and severity of Bright's injury. In addition, as in Koch, this does not serve as evidence that Gulf States and Bright were not free to do the work in their own way and is not evidence that Dow controlled the method of work or its operative details. The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that it is not *609 enough that the premises owner has merely a general right to order the work stopped (after work has commenced). Restatement (Second) of Torts § 414 cmt. c (1965). Likewise, Dow's general right under the safe work permit system to preclude work from beginning in the first instance is insufficient to establish actual control.\",\n",
       "  'This Court has recognized that a general contractor has actually exercised control of a premises when the general contractor knew of a dangerous condition before an injury occurred and approved acts that were dangerous and unsafe. See Lee Lewis Constr., 70 S.W.3d at 784 (\"Testimony indicated that C.L. Lewis personally witnessed and approved of the specific fall-protections systems KK Glass used. There was testimony that C.L. Lewis `definitely did approve\\' the lanyard system. There was also testimony that C.L. Lewis knew of and did not object to KK Glass employees using a bosun\\'s chair without an independent lifeline.\"); see also Hoechst-Celanese, 967 S.W.2d at 358 (\"[A]n employer who is aware that its contractor routinely ignores applicable federal guidelines and standard company policies related to safety may owe a duty to require corrective measures to be taken or to cancel the contract.\"). Had the Dow safety representative actually approved how the pipe in question was secured or instructed Bright to perform his work knowing of the dangerous condition, we could have a fact scenario mirroring Lee Lewis. However, we have never concluded that a general contractor actually exercised control of a premises where, as here, there was no prior knowledge of a dangerous condition and no specific approval of any dangerous act.',\n",
       "  \"Alternatively, Bright argues that Dow should have issued an additional safety rule detailing how the ends of pipes should be secured before allowing workers in an area. Dow's failure to implement such a safety rule is not actual control. Bright's argument fails to implicate the narrow duty of care not to promulgate safety regulations that unreasonably increase the risk or severity of injury.\",\n",
       "  \"Furthermore, Bright argues that Dow required contractors to report the name of any employee fired for a safety infraction; Dow required Gulf States to send its employees to a third-party safety meeting; and Dow had a Safety Incentive Program that rewarded contractors who had achieved certain safety milestones. These requirements do not implicate the narrow duty of care not to promulgate safety regulations that increase the risk or severity of injury, nor do they relate to Bright's injury.\",\n",
       "  'Bright further contends that Dow exercised actual control by retaining authority over the timing and sequence of work being done by the various independent contractors. The evidence in this case, however, establishes that Gulf States controlled the work performed by the pipefitter who placed the pipe that fell on Bright. As stated above, Gulf States was solely responsible for controlling the work performed by Bright. There is no evidence in the record that Dow was involved in any manner with controlling the timing and sequence of Bright\\'s work and deciding which Gulf States employees should perform what task and at what point in time. Bright did present evidence that the timing and sequence of Gulf States\\' work was indicated on a job efficiency matrix prepared and submitted by Gulf States and that, should the need arise, Dow and Gulf States could mutually agree to a modification. This is not evidence, however, that Dow controlled the timing and sequence of the erection of the pipe and Bright\\'s carpentry work in the area. See *610 Good v. Dow Chem. Co., 945 S.W.2d 877, 882 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ) (\"Good points to no safety manual provision that dictates how and when pipe shoes should be welded to the pipe, or how and when the pipe should be placed on the racks.\").',\n",

Dow argues that at most it owed a duty that any safety requirements and procedures it promulgated did not unreasonably increase, rather than decrease, the probability and severity of injury.',\n",

Additionally, neither The Dow Chemical Company nor its employees had the right to intervene nor did they intervene in any safety related matters during the construction of the off-gas compressor, the project which Mr. Bright was working on when he was injured.\",\n",

Bright\\'s counsel questioned the former Dow safety manager whether these were \"must comply\" standards. The former Dow safety manager answered: \"Not all of them.\"',\n",
       "  'In Bright\\'s motion for partial summary judgment, Bright argued that Dow had both a contractual and an actual right of control. With regard to his actual control argument and Dow\\'s safety policies, Bright argued that Dow \"issued a Texas Operations safety standard defining the minimum safeguards that Dow required of each operation.... Dow expected its contractors, including Larry Bright\\'s employer, to abide by the safety rules that Dow issued.\" Bright further argued that all contract employees were required to \"be indoctrinated with the Dow safety rules book.\" Finally, Bright concluded with the statement that \"[b]ecause Dow provided safety procedure manuals for all its contractors and contractors\\' employees, Dow exercised control sufficient to give rise to the duty of care owed to Larry Bright.\" Thus, Bright relied entirely on the mere existence of the safety regulations to establish actual control. But as we have stated, mere promulgation of safety policies does not establish actual control. Hoechst-Celanese, 967 S.W.2d at 357-58 (requiring an independent contractor to \"observe and promote compliance with federal laws, general safety guidelines, and other standard safety precautions [does] not impose an unqualified duty of care on [a premises owner] to ensure that [an independent contractor\\'s] employees [do] nothing unsafe\"); Koch, 11 S.W.3d at 156.

She had run away from home at age fifteen and had given birth to a daughter at age sixteen. Robert was thirty-six years old at the time and married to Bertha, a woman with whom he had fathered a son. He had an extensive criminal record, including convictions for drug offenses, theft, and assault. Robert sold drugs for a living and was an addict. In 1996, while living together, Susan told Robert she was pregnant with C.H. At about the same time, Susan relinquished parental rights to her daughter and consented to her daughter's adoption.\",\n",
       "  \"Susan was pregnant with C.H. when both she and Robert were arrested in 1996 for possession of cocaine and heroin. After her release, Susan voluntarily entered a drug-treatment program, but left the drug-treatment center in a matter of days. Shortly after his release, Robert was again arrested on other drug charges. Robert was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, a sentence he was serving at the time of trial.\",\n",
       "  \"Susan was incarcerated for the last five months of her pregnancy with C.H. She was released on probation ten days after his birth. Susan and C.H. resided in her mother's home for a few months, then they moved into an apartment with Susan's new boyfriend, Michael Russey. Following his drug conviction, Robert had minimal contact with either Susan or their son.\",\n",
       "  'In March 1997, about a month after Susan and C.H. moved in with Michael Russey, Russey flagged down a passing police car, reported that he had a physical confrontation with Susan and that narcotics were being used in his apartment. When the officers entered the apartment, they found Susan in the bedroom with another man whom she knew only as \"C.C.\" Two other couples were also in the apartment. C.H. was asleep in a playpen. The police found a spoon containing cocaine residue, matches, a plastic baggie, and empty balloons associated with heroin use near the child\\'s bed. Other drug paraphernalia littered the bedroom and bathroom. Witnesses testified that the apartment was filthy, with mounds of clothes strewn about, grease spattered on the walls, and broken windows throughout the unit.',\n",
       "  \"Susan testified that she and Russey had been smoking crack cocaine that night and had a violent argument. The police arrested Susan and charged her with cocaine possession. Emergency worker David Abogado from the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services took custody of C.H. Since that time, C.H. has remained in a foster family's care.\",\n",
       "  \"Robert testified about his extensive criminal history at the termination hearing. Over the course of five years, he had been arrested for theft, possession of narcotics, *21 aggravated assault of a police officer, and repeated violations of probation. Robert conceded that he continued his criminal activities even after he learned of Susan's pregnancy. He acknowledged that, as a result of his criminal proclivities, he was unable to be present for the child's birth or formative years. Robert testified that after he and Bertha divorced, he did not provide child support to or know the whereabouts of his fourteen-year-old son.\",\n",
       "  \"Robert had seen C.H. only twice since his birth, once when Susan visited Robert in the county jail and once when Robert visited Susan in her mother's home. Robert had never lived with C.H., did not contact the Department about C.H., and never paid child support nor arranged medical care for Susan or C.H. Robert testified that the only time he attempted to provide financial support for C.H. was when he gave money to an acquaintance, who purportedly promised to deliver it to Susan. Robert claimed that the friend absconded with the money. Robert testified he was currently unable to provide financial support to C.H.\",\n",
       "  \"Evidence contrary to the verdict was comprised primarily of Robert's testimony. Robert testified that he loved C.H. and wished to remain his parent. Robert and Susan both stated that Robert encouraged Susan to obtain medical treatment while she was pregnant with C.H. Robert also testified that he intended to seek employment when released from prison so that he could provide for C.H. Finally, Robert testified that he was auditing classes on chemical dependency while incarcerated.\",\n",

He testified that, while Robert was \"likeable,\" his ten-year prison sentence would impede his ability to be a parent to C.H. Dr. Park noted Robert\\'s illicit livelihood, his criminal record, and his refusal to take personal responsibility for his criminal background. Dr. Park also noted that Robert had abandoned his only other son.',\n",

Dr. Park and Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) volunteers observed that C.H. was developing normally and that he was an emotionally stable, happy boy. The Department initiated proceedings to terminate Susan's and Robert's parental rights so that C.H. could be placed with adoptive parents. On a broad-form submission, the jury found that Susan's and Robert's parent-child relationships with C.H. should be terminated, and the trial court rendered judgment accordingly.

See Tex. Fam.Code § 161.001(2). The court of appeals also concluded the evidence was factually sufficient to support the finding that the parents had engaged in section 161.001(1) conduct. With respect to Robert in particular, the court found that \"the series of arrests on drug offenses from April 1996 until November 1996, with full knowledge of [Susan\\'s] pregnancy and possible consequences of his course of conduct, implies that [Robert] had a conscious disregard and indifference to his parental responsibilities.\" 25 S.W.3d at 55.

It does not appear to show that he is an abusive or violent person, nor does it appear that he has psychological problems, apart from his drug addiction, that potentially puts his son at risk. The Department suggests that [Robert G.]'s imprisonment conclusively establishes a potential adverse psychological impact on C.H., but there is no evidence as to the significance of impact on an infant as opposed to an older child. There is no evidence, expert, medical, or otherwise, about C.H.'s present and future emotional and physical needs in the time periods relevant to this case.\",\n",

But Meadows has limited application in termination proceedings. In Meadows, we sought to reconcile decades of confusing and contradictory decisions using a clear-and-convincing standard, or some similarly-worded standard, in a variety of contexts.

But because this Court had subsequently required a third standard of clear-and-convincing proof at trial for involuntary termination of parental rights, the court in B.R. thought it appropriate for appellate courts to also employ a third standard of review.

Despite differences in articulated standards, the courts have often employed similar analyses in reaching their decisions. See In re Leal, v.

The court of appeals properly stated that appellate courts should not reverse the judgment unless the jury could not reasonably have formed a firm conviction or belief that terminating Robert\\'s parental rights was in C.H.\\'s best interest. However, the court did not properly adhere to that standard in reviewing the evidence. The court of appeals relied on some considerations this Court has said may be pertinent when deciding \"best interest.\" Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex.1976). But we have never held that these considerations are exhaustive, or that all such considerations must be proved as a condition precedent to parental termination. The absence of evidence about some of these considerations would not preclude a factfinder from reasonably forming a strong conviction or belief that termination is in the child\\'s best interest, particularly if the evidence were undisputed that the parental relationship endangered the safety of the child. Other cases, however, will present more complex facts in which paltry evidence relevant to each consideration mentioned in Holley would not suffice to uphold the jury\\'s finding that termination is required.',\n",

But, the opinion does not suggest that any of this evidence would be relevant to a determination of the child\\'s best interest. While it is true that proof of acts or omissions under section 161.001(1) does not relieve the petitioner from proving the best interest of the child, the same evidence may be probative of both issues.

The opinion also fails to account for Robert's testimony that he was unaware of the whereabouts of his fourteen-year-old son from his prior marriage and did not support him in any way. Robert's past performance as a parent\\x97apart from his criminal history\\x97could certainly have a bearing on his fitness to provide for C.H., yet the court of appeals did not mention Robert's prior history of child neglect as a factor bearing upon the jury's finding that termination would be in C.H.'s best interest.\",\n",

Tex. Fam.Code § 161.207. Evidence about placement plans and adoption are, of course, relevant to best interest. However, the lack of evidence about definitive plans for permanent placement and adoption cannot be the dispositive factor; otherwise, determinations regarding best interest would regularly be subject to reversal on the sole ground that an adoptive family has yet to be located. Instead, the inquiry is whether, on the entire record, a factfinder could reasonably form a firm conviction or belief that termination of the parent\\'s rights would be in the child\\'s best interest\\x97even if the agency is unable to identify with precision the child\\'s future home environment.',\n",

Following diagnostic testing, MHMR determined that Dixon was mildly retarded. MHMR also concluded that he was not dangerous to himself or others.

See 42 C.F.R. 483.420(c)(5) (\"The facility must promote frequent and informal leaves from the facility for visits, trips, or vacations.\"). His mother usually requested these visits, which were authorized by an interdisciplinary team[2] at Lakewood House.',\n",

He was verbally and physically abusive to Lakewood House staff, other residents of the facility, and other students at his school. While at school, he was involved in seven separate assaults, resulting in penalties ranging from detention, alternative school, suspension, and referral to law enforcement. In one incident, a fellow student was taken to a hospital for stitches after Dixon cut him with a piece of glass. The record further suggests that Dixon also assaulted other residents at Lakewood House.',\n",

During his spring break vacation in 1993, he was charged with aggravated assault when he brandished a hand gun after being caught trespassing on a construction site by the project\\'s supervisor. During the 1993 Thanksgiving holiday, he was apprehended after breaking into an apartment. The week before that, he had been caught shoplifting at a Wal-Mart store. Twice he took cars without the owner\\'s permission. On one of these occasions, he was apparently involved in a high-speed chase. On the other, he damaged his mother\\'s car, prompting her to ask THM to discontinue his home visitation \"until she cooled off.\" Finally, on the weekend of May 15, 1994, just two months after he had damaged his mother\\'s car, Dixon shot and killed Elizabeth Ann Peavy at a Houston convenience store, then stole her car.

Thus, THM concludes, it had no more right to control Dixon than did the doctor in Van Horn v.

       "  'THM asserts that it had limited authority to control Dixon because the State retained legal custody and both federal and state regulations encouraged his frequent visits to his mother\\'s home in Houston. We agree that federal and Texas Department of Human Services regulations generally favor such visits, although they do not expressly require them. 42 C.F.R. § 483.420(c)(5) (\"The facility must promote frequent and informal leaves from the facility for visits, trips, or vacations.\"); 16 Tex.

THM failed to produce summary judgment evidence that conclusively established that it had no choice but to release Dixon to Houston for a therapeutic visit. Although state and federal regulations encouraged therapeutic visits for Dixon to see his family in Houston, there is no summary judgment evidence that such state and federal regulations required THM to approve such visits when they presented an unreasonable risk to the safety of others. The dissent contends that state regulations mandated that facilities allow residents an unlimited number of therapeutic visits as well as some extended visits. However, the regulations *35 that the dissent relies on apply only to the conditions for which the intermediate care facility will be reimbursed when the client patient is away from the facility.[3] Moreover, these regulations clearly recognize that, rather than being \"mandated,\" therapeutic visits require authorization by a mental retardation professional and physician approval. 16 Tex. Reg. 3525, 3534-35 (1991) (formerly 40 Tex. Admin.

Reg. 3525, 3540 (1991) (formerly 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 27.707(c)(3)). However, there is no summary judgment evidence that THM convened a special committee to review Dixon\\'s maladaptive behaviors and recommend to the State of Texas his permanent discharge from its facility.

Under its contract with MHMR, THM provided Dixon not only with room and board, but also with a plan for his training and treatment.

This is a far cry from the limited and specific treatment provided by the defendant doctor in Van Horn.\",\n",
       "  'In Van Horn, the defendant physician treated a seizure patient for a portion of one day before releasing the patient to a private hospital room. We held that there is no duty of reasonable care toward third parties stemming from the ordinary physician-patient relationship: \"Any duty of reasonable care on Dr. Van Horn\\'s part to avoid [negligent misdiagnosis] originates solely through the relationship with, and flows only to, his patient.\" Van Horn, 970 S.W.2d at 545. Here, however, we are not concerned with a physician\\'s duty not to negligently misdiagnose a patient. Rather, we are concerned with the duty to *36 control. As we noted in Van Horn, there is generally no relationship between the doctor and patient that would provide the type of control necessary to create a duty to third persons: \"Aside from the fact that a physician-patient relationship is not `special\\' so as to impose a duty to control, as we have discussed, there is nothing inherent in the relationship that gives a doctor the right to control his patient.\" Id. at 547. Thus, we concluded that Otis Engineering, in which we recognized a duty based on the right to control implicit in the master-servant relationship, does not apply to a case in which there is no inherent right to control another, such as in the ordinary physician-patient relationship. Id. But here, in contrast to Van Horn, there is a right to control that arises from THM\\'s contract with the State, which incorporates applicable state and federal regulations and standards.

THM submits that it had no reason to view Dixon as dangerous because the district court specifically found that he was neither a danger to himself or others when it granted custody to MHMR. However, the district court made that determination in 1991, when Dixon was fourteen. The finding does not establish as a matter of law that seventeen-year-old Dixon was not dangerous in 1994 or that THM should not have reasonably recognized that he had become dangerous by that time.',\n",
       "  \"THM continuously assessed Dixon's social, psychological, and educational progress in quarterly reports filed with MHMR. THM employed a Qualified Mental Retardation Professional (QMRP), to prepare reports tracking Dixon's accomplishments *37 and failures during the period.[6] These reports are at least some evidence that THM was aware of Dixon's dangerous propensities. The Peavys' summary judgment evidence, taken largely from testimony during Dixon's murder trial and THM's own records, documents that Dixon was involved in nineteen assaults, seven other instances of criminal conduct, and nine incidents of verbal threats while he resided at Lakewood House. The summary judgment evidence also indicated that Dixon's behavior was more manageable in a structured environment, and there is evidence that his mother's home was not such an environment. While Dixon engaged in criminal conduct both in Nacogdoches and Houston, there is evidence that the incidents were more serious in Houston. In Nacogdoches, Dixon's misconduct generally consisted of altercations with fellow students at school and with other residents at Lakewood House. His most serious offense involved cutting a fellow student with a piece of glass. On brief visits to Houston, however, Dixon burglarized an apartment and threatened its occupant, trespassed on private property, committed assault with a hand gun, and stole two cars. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, see Nixon v. Mr. Property Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex.1985), these incidents suggest that Dixon was prone to theft and violence, especially during trips to Houston, where he lacked supervision, and that THM should have foreseen the danger inherent in these trips.\",\n",
       "  'Finally, THM argues that even if it owed some duty of care, that duty was limited to those groups about which THM had specific knowledge that Dixon posed a threat. Specifically, THM submits that he only exhibited violence towards those he knew, either classmates or other Lakewood House residents. Therefore, THM concludes that it could not have foreseen that he posed a danger to Ms. Peavy, a person he did not know.',\n",
       "  'But THM ignores other evidence suggesting that Dixon posed a danger to total strangers in Houston. The project manager at the Houston construction site where Dixon trespassed testified that he was \"scared as hell\" when Dixon pointed a gun at him during the 1993 spring break incident. Another stranger, the apartment resident who caught Dixon burglarizing his home, testified about his shock and fear at discovering Dixon hiding behind a shower *38 curtain during Dixon\\'s 1993 Thanksgiving holiday. While he did not have a weapon on that occasion, Dixon told the man that he had a friend with a gun hiding in a closet. Thus, while Dixon may not have accosted strangers in Nacogdoches as he did in Houston, his life at Lakewood House had more structure and less opportunity for mischief.',\n",

In that case, a private halfway house accepted a convicted felon for residence under a contract with the Virginia Department of Corrections. Inmates were permitted to leave during the day, but the halfway house was required to monitor their whereabouts. One night, an inmate left the house, broke into a nearby apartment, and strangled a woman to death. Holding that the halfway house owed a duty to the victim, the Virginia Supreme Court wrote that the scope of the duty varied with the circumstances of each case. If the defendant \"takes charge\" of a person who is dangerous only to a specific individual, the defendant\\'s duty runs \"only to that individual because the risk of injury from a breach of the duty would be foreseeable only as to that prospective victim.\" Id. at 883. But the court observed that the duty would more often run to all reasonably within the reach of the dangerous person. Id.',\n",

There, the victim lived in a city 150 miles away and was sexually assaulted three days after the prisoner's escape from the halfway house. Id. at 684.

THM points to the Texas Health and Safety Code\\'s statement that \"[i]t is the public policy of this state that persons with mental retardation have the opportunity to develop to the fullest extent possible their potential for becoming productive members of society.\" Tex.

       "  'That deficiency is the Court\\'s failure to distinguish between the Peavys\\' claims that implicate a duty owed by a mental health care provider to third parties for failure to diagnose or treat a patient properly, which we have consistently held that Texas law does not recognize, and issues of pure \"control\" that are unrelated to any professional diagnosis or treatment of a patient.',\n",
       "  \"The third area in which the Court's opinion is devoid of careful analysis is, what ability did Texas Home Management actually have to control Anthony Dixon and how should that ability to control have been exercised?\",\n",
       "  \"I would hold that the duty Texas Home Management owed to third parties such as Elizabeth Peavy was to report promptly to MHMR and appropriate law enforcement authorities all pertinent facts about Anthony Dixon's violations of the law and any serious aggressive acts so that 1) MHMR could determine whether it should place Dixon elsewhere and 2) law enforcement officials could decide whether to pursue pending or additional criminal charges against him or to pursue further juvenile delinquency proceedings based on his criminal acts. If the Peavys could demonstrate that state actors would have taken actions that would have prevented their daughter's murder, then the Peavys would *41 have established a cause of action. But to the extent that the Peavys' claims rest on the failure of Texas Home Management or its agents to diagnose and treat Anthony Dixon's violent proclivities properly, those claims cannot survive based on this Court's decisions in Thapar v. Zezulka,[4]Van Horn v. Chambers,[5] and Bird v. W.C.W.[6]\",\n",
       "  'We squarely held in Van Horn that the ability to control a mental health patient does not give rise to a duty to third parties to properly diagnose and treat that patient.[7] The allegation that Texas Home Management reasonably knew or should have known that Anthony Dixon presented an unreasonable risk of danger to third parties and failed to control him is indistinguishable from allegations in Van Horn that the health care provider \"failed to see that [the patient] was transferred to a proper facility to handle his violent and disruptive behavior\" and \"permitted [the patient] to remain on an unsecured floor after he exhibited signs that he would erupt into violent and disruptive behavior.\"[8] The allegations against Texas Home Management are also indistinguishable from allegations in Thapar that the mental health care provider was negligent \"in her diagnosis and treatment of [the patient\\'s] psychiatric problems,\" \"in releasing [the patient] from the hospital,\" \"in failing to have [the patient] involuntarily committed,\" and \"in failing to monitor [the patient] after his release to ensure that he was taking his medication.\"[9] In both Thapar and Van Horn, a patient brought about the death of someone while under the care of a health care provider.[10]',\n",
       "  'Instead of imposing a duty tailored to fit both the needs of the mentally retarded who have a history of behavioral problems and the general public\\'s need for safety, the Court imposes a broad duty of \"control,\" but there are internal inconsistencies in the Court\\'s opinion regarding \"control.\" A duty to \"control\" cannot exceed the ability to control. Because Anthony Dixon was violent over a long period of time in differing settings after MHMR placed him with Texas Home Management, the duty to \"control\" that the Court imposes today cannot logically be limited to simply preventing Dixon from visiting his mother in Houston. Yet that is the Court\\'s focus. Texas Home Management could not have allowed Dixon to attend public schools or to intermingle with others without close supervision and the ability to subdue him physically if necessary. That authority was not given to Texas Home Management by MHMR. Rather, MHMR chose Texas Home Management for Anthony Dixon precisely because the Lakewood Facility offered what MHMR considered to be the \"least restrictive alternative.\"[11] The facts *42 are undisputed that the Lakewood facility did not provide incarceration in any form and that the facility was not designed to contain and did not contain any security gates or locked doors. Any decision to place Dixon in an environment restrictive enough to prevent violent acts against others rested with MHMR, law enforcement officials, and ultimately the courts. Even after MHMR placed Dixon with Texas Home Management, he was arrested for aggravated assault during his spring vacation in 1993, more than a year before he murdered Elizabeth Peavy. He was taken into custody by law enforcement officials again in November of 1993, six months before the murder. Confining Dixon during that entire time and beyond would have been necessary to prevent what the Court says was a foreseeable homicide.[12] But the State did not choose confinement for Dixon.',\n",

But the motion for summary judgment filed by Texas Home Management did not assert that it was entitled to summary judgment on either of these grounds. Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment remanding this case to the trial court for further proceedings but not in the Court's opinion.\",\n",

Anthony Dixon's father died sometime before Anthony was committed to MHMR's custody. When MHMR placed Anthony at the Lakeside facility, he required not only mental health treatment but instruction in very basic skills such as eating with a knife, fork and spoon; chewing food with his mouth closed; not talking while chewing; how to brush his teeth; how and when to wash his hair; how to walk down grocery store aisles without being disruptive; toilet training to some degree; and many other basic hygiene and living skills.\",\n",

Long before he was committed to MHMR\\'s custody, he was referred to juvenile authorities for auto theft, for \"mischief,\" for evading arrest, and as a chronic runaway. In 1988, about two or three years before he was civilly committed to MHMR\\'s custody, Dixon was placed on juvenile probation. In 1990, when Dixon was thirteen, he was charged with burglary of a building. Instead of moving forward with juvenile delinquency proceedings, the State alleged that Anthony Dixon was mentally retarded and requested that the district court place him in a residential facility. The district court ordered diagnostic evaluation, and it was determined that Dixon\\'s verbal IQ was 40 and his performance IQ was 61. He was diagnosed as \"mildly mentally retarded.\" Based on the experts\\' evaluations, the district court found that Dixon was a mentally retarded person, but that he was not dangerous to himself or others. The district *43 court committed Dixon to MHMR\\'s custody. Pursuant to former section 55.03 of the Juvenile Justice Code, the then-pending delinquency proceedings were stayed while Dixon received court-ordered mental health services that were ultimately provided by Texas Home Management.[13]',\n",

The State could have sought to have him committed to the Austin State Hospital or another facility in which he could be confined. It did not. Instead, the proper state authorities chose a residential facility that had no ability to confine Dixon and that was to send him to special education classes at a public school and to send him home to Houston for frequent visits with his mother and other family members. When Dixon was repeatedly involved in further criminal conduct for more than three years while a resident at Texas Home Management's facility, state authorities still did not seek to reinstate the juvenile delinquency proceedings or to prosecute Dixon as an adult. Instead, they chose to leave Dixon at an intermediate care, residential treatment facility. The state authorities, including MHMR, are, of course, immune from liability to third parties for making these judgment calls because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the fact that the Texas Tort Claims Act does not waive sovereign immunity under the circumstances of this case.[14]\",\n",

The question this Court should ask, therefore, is what duty a mental health care provider owes to third parties to recognize that a patient has become dangerous.\",\n",
       "  'I submit that the Court has answered this question in at least three decisions, Thapar v. Zezulka,[18]Van Horn v. Chambers,[19] and Bird v. W.C.W.[20] In Thapar, a patient, while hospitalized, told his mental health care provider that he felt like killing his stepfather.[21] Within a month after his release from the hospital, he did in fact kill his stepfather.[22] The allegations in the suit that followed were that the physician was negligent in releasing the patient from the hospital, in failing to take steps to have him involuntarily committed, and in failing *45 to monitor him after his release to ensure that he was taking his medication.[23] This Court held unequivocally that \"Bird and our post-Bird writings answer definitively the first duty question presented by the facts before us: [the mental health care provider] owes no duty to Zezulka, a third party nonpatient, for negligent misdiagnosis or negligent treatment of [the patient].\"[24] This holding did not depend on the degree of control that the mental health care provider had over the patient. The physician in Thapar certainly had the ability to refrain from releasing the patient when he or she did, had the ability to at least ask appropriate authorities to involuntarily commit the patient, and had the ability to monitor the patient to ensure that he was taking his medication.',\n",
       "  'The facts in Van Horn are even more analogous to the ones before us today. Van Horn treated a man who was admitted to a hospital displaying \"combative\" tendencies.[25] For the first two days, the patient was physically constrained with leather restraints.[26] Van Horn then determined that the patient no longer needed the restraints and could be moved to a private room.[27] The patient then attempted to leave the hospital, and hospital personnel attempted to prevent him from doing so.[28] In the chase and struggle that ensued, two hospital employees were killed and another was injured.[29] The subsequent negligence claims against Van Horn included allegations that he failed to diagnose properly the patient\\'s condition, failed to prevent the patient\\'s transfer to an unsecured floor with inadequate facilities to treat the patient\\'s violent behavior, failed to see that the patient was transferred to a proper facility to handle his violent behavior, and failed to order mandatory physical restraints.[30] We observed that \"[t]he gravamen of the plaintiffs\\' complaints is that Van Horn knew or should have known that [the patient] posed a danger to others and should have treated him accordingly.\"[31] But once again, this Court\\'s decision about the duty that Van Horn owed to third parties did not turn on control. To the contrary, we clearly said that Van Horn \"may have had a basis for continuing physical restraint,\"[32] and then said that his failure to order further physical restraint \"could amount to medical negligence, but only against one to whom a duty is owed,\" which we said was only the patient, not third parties.[33]',\n",
       "  \"I cannot square the Court's decision today with Van Horn. The Court says that in balancing the traditional factors we consider in determining when a court will impose a duty, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded owe a duty to third parties to properly diagnose and respond to a patient's violent behavior. But the balancing test came out just the opposite in Van Horn on very similar facts.[34] The only difference in the two cases is that *46 in Van Horn the patient was voluntarily committed.[35]\",\n",
       "  'The Court attempts to distinguish Van Horn, saying \"[h]ere, however, we are not concerned with a physician\\'s duty not to negligently misdiagnose a patient. Rather, we are concerned with the duty to control.\"[36] But the Court\\'s opinion and the state and federal regulations it cites demonstrate beyond question that we are dealing with mental health care providers\\' professional diagnoses.',\n",
       "  'The Court recognizes that Dixon was treated by an interdisciplinary team provided by Texas Home Management that included mental retardation professionals.[37] The Court explains that \"THM continuously assessed Dixon\\'s social, psychological, and educational progress in quarterly reports filed with MHMR. THM employed a Qualified Mental Retardation Professional (QMRP), to prepare reports tracking Dixon\\'s accomplishments and failures during the period.\"[38] The Court also recognizes that Texas Home Management \"provided Dixon not only with room and board, but also with a plan for his training and treatment. Professionals employed by THM continually monitored and reported on Dixon\\'s progress to the state.\"[39] The record is thus clear that Texas Home Management\\'s function was to provide professional mental health services to Dixon. Texas Home Management\\'s decisions about Dixon\\'s interaction with members of the public and his family were a direct exercise of professional judgment about the treatment of a mental health client.',\n",

State regulations required that \"[t]he psychologist must participate *48 in the release planning if the reason for release is the individual\\'s display of maladaptive behavior that the facility is unable to treat successfully.\"[56] And, before a facility could release a client because of \"maladaptive behavior(s) that [it] is unable to address successfully,\" the facility was required to \"provide evidence, in the individual\\'s record, of the interdisciplinary team\\'s attempts to manage the behavior(s).

Dixon stabbed or otherwise intentionally cut a student at his Nacogdoches public school with a piece of glass, and he was verbally and physically abusive to other students at his school.

While it is true that Elizabeth Peavy might not have been killed if Texas Home Management had prevented Dixon from going home the particular weekend that he did, the duty imposed by the Court would require Texas Home Management to confine Dixon virtually at all times, even precluding him from attending school, in order to protect third parties from his violent acts.

We also now know that if the district court that committed Dixon to the Authority's custody in 1991 was correct when it found that Dixon, then fourteen, was not dangerous, it was certainly not prophetic. No one who has ever tried over the years to habilitate Dixon, who has an IQ of about 50\\x97not his mother, nor any of a slew of social workers, counselors, teachers, psychologists, and psychiatrists\\x97has been able to prevent him from breaking the law or physically assaulting people around him\\x97students, roommates, and strangers, young and old, both in Nacogdoches and Houston\\x97many, many times. With what we all know now, it was probably a mistake for Dixon not to have been locked away long before Elizabeth Peavy's tragic, senseless death.\",\n",

It was the state district court that made the decision to commit Dixon to the custody of the Authority, and it was the *51 Authority, a local governmental entity exercising powers delegated by the State Board of Mental Health and Mental Retardation,[1] that made the decision to place Dixon at Lakewood House, the \"least restrictive habilitation setting\", the setting to which Dixon was statutorily entitled.[2] These decisions were made in the salutary hope that Dixon\\'s would not be another life wasted in prison, a hope the State has for all others in his shoes. At Lakewood House, Dixon was not an unusual case. He was, according to one social worker, \"pretty much the same\" as the other five mentally retarded boys placed in Lakewood House. He was \"not the leading trouble-maker\", another testified. He was, in short, typical of many if not most mentally retarded juvenile delinquents who have found it beyond themselves to refrain from violence. To keep society perfectly safe from such potential malefactors, the State would have no choice but to incarcerate them\\x97Dixon, to be sure, but also everyone else like Dixon.

Indeed, facilities are permitted to charge only for very specific services and none other, and are obliged to accept as full payment for all such services the amounts prescribed by set governmental schedules. Nothing in the contract or regulations permits a facility to charge for the risk that a resident will repeat the violent or unlawful behavior that landed him in the facility in the first place.

In so doing, the Court undermines the State's policy of habilitation of mentally retarded juvenile delinquents. Care providers unwilling to risk such liability will withdraw from the market, leaving the State with fewer providers from which to choose. Unless the risks of liability can be lowered, or the compensation for services increased, the ability of private facilities to provide necessary services impairs State policy.\",\n",
       "  'Both to justify this anti-public-policy rule, and also apparently to try to limit it, the Court imposes two conditions on its application: a facility must reasonably know that a resident \"presents a danger to third parties,\"[7] and a facility must have assumed responsibility for \"control\" of the resident. The first condition is always met. The \"danger\", keep in mind, is not merely the risk that a resident will commit murder, something that is highly unlikely; \"danger\" includes the risk that a resident will harm in any way, something that for many residents is next to certain. THM can argue convincingly that it had no way of knowing that Dixon would commit murder, but it cannot thereby avoid liability, for it can never claim with a straight face that it had no idea that Dixon presented a danger to third parties. Within months after the district court found that Dixon was not dangerous, THM found that he was. All the time he was placed at Lakewood House, Dixon was never anything other than a danger to third parties. He regularly assaulted schoolmates, roommates, and others he encountered in Nacogdoches, cut one of them with a piece of glass, and pulled a gun on a man in Houston. It is no use for THM to argue that it had no reason to believe Dixon was murderous. for all the harm Dixon caused if THM knew that Dixon was dangerous to anyone. Nor can it be expected that THM\\'s position is unique in this regard. Every intermediate care facility for mentally retarded delinquents is in exactly the same position. Every one of them knows full well that some if not all of their residents are dangerous to third parties. The very reason care is being provided is to try to reduce or remove that danger and restore the residents to acceptable community life.',\n",
       "  \"It must be stressed that the Court's rule would make THM liable not only for Elizabeth Peavy's tragic death, but for every assault Dixon ever committed. This is a tragic and one would hope extraordinary case, but the rule announced applies whenever *53 a facility knows that a resident is dangerous. THM may be liable to the person Dixon assaulted with a gun, the person he cut with a piece of glass, the numerous people he assaulted, even to Dixon's mother for the damage he did to her car.\",\n",
       "  'On the other hand, the Court\\'s second condition, \"control\", can never be met with respect to intermediate care facilities if control means anything significant. The Court has not found a single word in the standard form contract that either authorized or obligated THM to control its residents, and in fact none exists. State regulations provided that \"[n]o participating facility may ... prohibit[] an individual from leaving the facility at will except as provided by state law\".[8] All this means, the Court says, is that visits home are \"generally favor[ed]\" but not \"expressly require[d].\"[9] A state statute required that \"[e]ach client has the right to live in the least restrictive habilitation setting and to be treated and served in the least intrusive manner appropriate to the client\\'s individual needs.\"[10] This means, in the Court\\'s view, that clients can be locked up if necessary. Federal regulations stated that every resident had \"the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience\"[11] and from \"verbal, sexual, physical, and mental abuse, corporal punishment, and involuntary seclusion.\"[12] This means, according to the Court, that unruly residents can be restrained or punished if appropriate. The summary judgment record establishes that Lakewood House had no security gates or locked doors. It was a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home in a residential neighborhood, like any other house on the block except that it had a staff member present around the clock. It was not designed to confine residents at least in part because confinement was illegal. On the contrary, state regulations mandated that facilities allow residents an unlimited number of \"therapeutic visits\",[13] defined as three-day absences from the residence for therapeutic purposes, such as weekend trips to home and family,[14] and some extended, ten-day therapeutic visits.[15] Somewhat more broadly, federal regulations required facilities to \"[p]romote frequent and informal leaves from the facility or visits, trips, or vacations\".[16] The Court dismisses state regulations requiring therapeutic visits as simply authorizing payment to the facility for periods when residents are away, but the words themselves cannot fairly be so limited.',\n",
       "  '*54 THM could not confine Dixon to Lakewood House or even to Nacogdoches. Legally, THM could not even confine Dixon to his room and make him stay there. He could leave Lakewood House any time he wanted, and if he did, THM had but one alternative: to abandon hope for habilitation and release him because of \"maladaptive behavior\"\\x97in the bureaucratic language of the state regulations[17]\\x97in effect returning him to the juvenile court for punishment.[18] This authority given THM to continue to try to treat Dixon or else give up is what the Court calls \"control\" for which THM may be liable.',\n",
       "  'We have never before called something like THM\\'s authority over Dixon \"control\". We have held that an employer who sends an intoxicated employee home has exercised such control over him so as to be liable for any accident he causes along the way,[19] and a vacuum manufacturer who requires salesmen to go into homes has exercised control over them so as to be liable for their sexual assaults of homeowners.[20] But we have also held that a taxicab company does not exercise such control over its drivers so as to be liable for their shooting other motorists.[21] And closer to the facts of the case before us, we have held that a physician does not exercise such control over a patient\\'s treatment as to render him liable to hospital employees for the patient\\'s violence,[22] nor does a psychiatrist exercise such control over a patient as to render him liable for the patient\\'s murder of his stepfather.[23] The Court dismisses these last two cases as \"not analogous\" because both involved doctor-patient relationships. The question remains: if a doctor is not liable for his patient\\'s assault of hospital employees allegedly due to the doctor\\'s failure to prescribe the appropriate treatment for the patient, treatment that would have kept the patient from violence, how can it be that an intermediate care facility is liable for a resident\\'s violent conduct when the facility had no legal right or practical way to stop the resident?',\n",
       "  \"The Court concludes that THM did not establish its lack of a duty as a matter of law, though the material facts are not in dispute here. THM's staff kept detailed notes on Dixon's daily activities. All the misconduct the Court recites is taken from THM's notes. From THM's records, not only could a jury find that THM should have known that Dixon was dangerous, no jury could reasonably disagree. Dixon hurt people and broke the law, repeatedly. THM's only control over the situation was to continue to try to habilitate Dixon or abandon him to the penal system. In choosing the former, THM was following the policy of the State of Texas that called for removing mentally retarded youths from the criminal justice system and placing them with private homes in the least *55 restrictive settings appropriate. Intermediate care facilities, whose only purpose is to restore young lives, do not make the State's policy and cannot fairly be made responsible for its unattained hopes.\",\n",
       "  \"The concurring opinion would hold that THM had a duty to report Dixon's misconduct to the State and that a fact question remains whether it did so. The opinion seems not to notice that almost everything we know about Dixon's misconduct preceding the murder, recited in both the Court's opinion and the concurring opinion, was contained in THM's detailed reports to the State. It is not clear what else THM should have reported. Furthermore, the opinion points out that the State undertook to make its own review of Dixon's progress every 180 days. There is nothing before us to suggest that the State did not know full well what progress Dixon had made and what problems persisted.\",\n",
       "  \"On this record, should THM reasonably have foreseen that Dixon would commit murder? Absolutely not, no more than Elizabeth Peavy should have foreseen that she might be assaulted at a convenience store. This case is about the loss of two lives, not just one. Elizabeth Peavy is dead. Dixon stood trial for capital murder and was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Neither loss was the fault of a home for retarded boys. Today's decision does not redress tragedy; it repeats tragedy.\",\n",

She sued the City of Bellmead, the owner of the complex, for premises defect. The City defended under the Recreational Use Statute, asserting that because Torres did not allege that the City's actions were willful, wanton, or grossly negligent, it was entitled to summary judgment. The trial court agreed. But the court of appeals concluded that softball, the reason Torres was at the complex in the first place, was not a recreational activity.[3] It therefore reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case for trial.[4] Because the court of appeals erred, we reverse and render judgment for the City.\",\n",

The first was in 1997, when the Legislature included \"any other activity associated with enjoying nature or the outdoors.\"[10] The second was in 1999, when the Legislature added subsection (e) to section 75.002 to include indoor hockey or skating at a municipally owned or operated facility.[11] The controlling question is whether the Recreational Use Statute applies.

Instead, according to the City, the landowner\\'s intent should control the inquiry into what is recreation.

If the permission was for a recreational activity, then the Recreational Use Statute applies.',\n",
       "  \"But this articulation only goes so far. If the Legislature intended that the intent of the owner, lessee, or occupant control, there would have been no need for it to list recreational activities.[17] There are many activities for which a landowner could easily give permission that one might consider recreation. But the Legislature provided a list of recreational activities, and because neither sitting on a swing nor playing softball are listed in the Statute's examples, we must decide which activity should be the focus and whether the Legislature intended to include that activity as recreation.\",\n",

The court of appeals erred in reasoning that the relevant inquiry was whether softball is recreation as defined by the Statute[18] because Torres did not allege that there was any defect in the softball field, bases, fences, or dugout. She alleged that there was a defect in the swing. All negligence causes of action require a causal relation between the injury and the injury-causing event.[19] In a premises defect case, the dangerous condition must be a cause of the resulting injury.[20] The court of appeals' conclusion that Torres's intent to play softball is controlling detaches this necessary causal link. Under the court of appeals' analysis, the City could be held liable for injuries caused by a defective swing set because it concluded that softball is not recreation. This simply does not follow. Stated another way, even though there is a premises defect, if it in no way contributes to an injury, it cannot be the basis for a cause of action for the premises defect.\",\n",

While playing or watching softball or using or sitting on a swing are activities that can occur outdoors, the general phrase must be read in connection with the list that precedes it. Hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, nature study, and the other listed activities limit the broader general meaning of recreation and convey a theme different from that of sports facilities and playgrounds.

And the Court's decision today has the effect of removing parks from the list of governmental functions for which a municipality's sovereign immunity is waived under the Tort Claims Act, simply because parks are usually located outdoors and the Court has decided that any activity occurring outdoors is within the scope of the recreational use statute.

       "  \"Jose Luis Garza applied to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) to *3 renew a beer and wine retailer's on-premises license for the Tropicana Night Club in Rosenberg, Texas. The TABC denied Garza's application and ordered him to submit an application to the constitutional county court. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code § 61.49. On October 28, 1997, the county judge, sitting in an administrative capacity, signed a judgment denying renewal of the permit. Garza's motion for rehearing was overruled by operation of law. See Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.146(c).\",\n",
       "  'On January 9, 1998, Garza appealed the county judge\\'s order to the 268th District Court, which conducted a hearing on January 16, 1998. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code §§ 11.67(a), 61.34(a). In a written judgment, the district court held that the county judge committed reversible error by limiting Garza to five trial witnesses. The district court vacated the administrative judgment and remanded the case to the county judge for further proceedings. The district court\\'s judgment recited that the court \"rendered its decision on January 20, 1998.\" However, the court actually signed the judgment on January 28, 1998. On remand, the county judge conducted a second hearing, at which the judge again denied Garza\\'s renewal application. Garza appealed the county judge\\'s second decision to the 240th District Court. That district court denied the license renewal on January 6, 1999 and Garza appealed to the court of appeals.',\n",
       "  'With one judge dissenting, the court of appeals held that the 268th District Court lacked jurisdiction at the time it remanded the case to the county judge because it did not render judgment within ten days following Garza\\'s January 9, 1998 appeal to that court. 83 S.W.3d 161. The court of appeals vacated the subsequent judgments of the county judge and the district court and dismissed the appeal, effectively leaving in place the county judge\\'s October 28, 1997 administrative order denying the renewal application. Disagreeing with that result, the dissent concluded that \"the legislature [did not intend] to preclude appeal by a party who has done everything required under the Texas Alcohol Beverage Code, just because the trial court failed to meet its responsibilities.\" Id. at 169 (Larsen, J., dissenting).',\n",

       "  'Generally, on appeal from an administrative denial of a liquor license, the district court conducts an abbreviated hearing[1] and renders a decision within ten days after the appeal is filed. See id. § 11.67(a), (b). At the district court\\'s discretion, the decision to withhold the license may be suspended pending the abbreviated hearing. Id. § 11.67(b)(4). However, a final judgment, once rendered, takes immediate effect and cannot be suspended pending an appeal to the court of appeals. Id. The statute makes no provision for a disposition in the event the district court does not render judgment within ten days. We address that issue today. We have held that section 11.67(b)(2) requires all proceedings in the district court to be completed within ten days of the date the appeal is filed. Cook v. Walker, 529 S.W.2d 762, 762 (Tex.1975); Cook v. Spears, 524 S.W.2d 290, 292 (Tex.1975). In Spears, we discussed the legislative history of article 666-15e, section 7a of the Texas Liquor Control Act, which is the predecessor to Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code section 11.67(b). 524 S.W.2d at 291. We observed that the earliest version of the Act required only that an appeal be tried within ten days or at the earliest possible time thereafter \"in the event the Judge is not able to try such cause within such ten (10) day period.\" Id. at 291 n. 2 (emphasis omitted) (citing Texas Liquor Control Act, 44th Leg., 2d C.S., ch. 467, art. I, § 14, 1935 Tex. Gen. Laws 1795, 1803).',\n",
       "  'The Legislature subsequently amended that provision by striking the language permitting a judge to extend the trial beyond the ten-day period. See Act of May 22, 1937, 45th Leg., R.S., ch. 448, art. I, § 15, 1937 Tex. Gen. Laws 1053, 1066. In 1961, the Legislature added article 666-15e to the Liquor Control Act and declared that the terms of the statute, including the ten-day-trial rule, \"shall be considered literally.\" Act of May 25, 1961, 57th Leg., R.S., ch. 262, § 7a, 1961 Tex. Gen. Laws 559, 561. Based on the Legislature\\'s systematic efforts to constrict the timetable within which judgment must be rendered, we concluded in Spears that the appeal *5 period in the district court could not exceed the statutory ten-day limit. 524 S.W.2d at 291-92. Thus, we held that the permittee in Spears, who sought a continuance and further discovery well beyond the ten-day period for court action, lost his right to a district court appeal when the period elapsed without a district court judgment. Id.',\n",
       "  \"We reached a similar conclusion in Cook v. Walker. There, although the license applicant filed an appeal to the district court on March 26, 1975, the judge did not set the matter for trial until May 2, 1975. Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762. Because more than ten days expired between the filing date and the trial date, we concluded that the applicant's right to a district court appeal expired at the end of the tenth day. Id.\",\n",
       "  'Garza contends that Spears and Walker are distinguishable because, in this case, the district court actually heard the matter eight days after Garza filed his appeal. This distinction is significant if, as Garza asserts, the \"trial\" in section 11.67(b)(2) refers only to a hearing on the merits and does not necessitate rendition of judgment. In support of his argument, Garza cites Fox v. Medina, 848 S.W.2d 866 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1993, no writ). In Fox, the district court conducted its hearing and rendered an oral judgment in open court within ten days of the date the appeal was filed, but did not sign the judgment until after the expiration of the statutory period. Id. at 870. Rather than require the appellant to obtain a written judgment within ten days, the court of appeals reasoned that \"the better course is to have trial judges hear or `try\\' the case within 10 days and render judgment in that period, but not to strip appellants of their appeal and render for appellees automatically if the judge does not sign the written judgment within 10 days.\" Id. at 871 n. 3.',\n",
       "  'We agree with Fox that \"trial,\" as used in section 11.67, refers to a hearing on the merits and rendition of judgment. And regardless of how rendition occurs, section 11.67 does not prevent a district court from performing the ministerial act of memorializing a timely rendition in a signed judgment after the ten-day period has passed. However, Garza asks this Court to hold that the district court may defer rendering judgment until some point in time after the ten-day period has expired. We decline to do so. Garza\\'s suggested interpretation of the term \"trial\" under section 11.67(b) would leave the district court free of the statute\\'s time limitations and able to delay rendition indefinitely. We cannot reconcile this result with the Legislature\\'s express decision to confine the trial of a licensing appeal to a rigid ten-day time limit. See Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291. Considering the statute as a whole, it is evident that section 11.67(b) was designed to secure a speedy disposition of administrative appeals. If we were to adopt Garza\\'s position\\x97that a district court may delay rendition indefinitely\\x97a business could continue operating more than ten days after the appeal is filed even when (as here) a county court has concluded that the business imperils the general welfare, health, peace, morals, and safety of the people. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code § 61.42(a)(3). The statute itself forecloses Garza\\'s argument. Section 11.67(b)(4) provides that \"the order, decision, or ruling of the commission or administrator may be suspended or modified by the court pending a trial on the merits, but the final judgment of the district court may not be modified or suspended pending appeal.\" The Legislature made certain that a business found to endanger public safety would cease operations during the pendency of further appeals. Garza\\'s interpretation *6 would contravene the statute by removing this safeguard.',\n",
       "  \"We conclude section 11.67(b) requires that judgment be rendered no later than ten days after the licensee perfects its appeal to the district court. Because the statute creates an absolute deadline for rendition of judgment, district courts have no power to render judgment or entertain post-judgment motions after expiration of the ten-day period. See Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292; McBeth v. Riverside Inn Corp., 593 S.W.2d 734, 736 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.). We disapprove of cases holding that a district court has plenary power to grant a new trial or vacate, modify, or reform a judgment after expiration of the ten-day-trial period. See Texas Alco. Beverage Comm'n v. Top of the Strip, Inc., 993 S.W.2d 242 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1999, pet. denied); El-Kareh v. Texas Alco. Beverage Comm'n, 874 S.W.2d 192 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ).\",\n",
       "  'Our analysis is consistent with our holdings in other contexts. See Lawyers Lloyds of Texas v. Webb, 137 Tex. 107, 152 S.W.2d 1096, 1097 (1941) (stating that \"trial\" ordinarily includes every step in the determination of the issues between parties including hearings on post judgment motions for new trial, but defining \"actual trial\" in the writ of error statute as the hearing in open court, leading up to the rendition of judgment); see also McBeth, 593 S.W.2d at 736 (applying the Lawyers Lloyds definition of \"trial\" to a section 11.67(b) appeal). Accordingly, a district court\\'s judgment in a section 11.67 appeal must be rendered within ten days of the date the appeal is filed. Although the 268th District Court signed a judgment remanding the case to the county court on January 28, 1998, that attempted rendition occurred outside the strict ten-day period conferred by the statute; therefore, the January 28, 1998 judgment and all subsequent proceedings in the district court are void.',\n",

We agree with the TABC.\",\n",

Despite the order\\'s pronouncement that the court \"took this matter under advisement and rendered its decision on January 20, 1998,\" nothing in the record shows that the district court rendered judgment orally in open court, or otherwise publicly announced its decision, before the ten-day deadline expired. Thus, we must determine whether the record reflects a memorandum *7 of decision filed on or before January 20, 1998.',\n",
       "  'In an effort to resolve this question, the court of appeals ordered the Fort Bend County District Clerk to file a supplemental clerk\\'s record \"containing any memorandum of decision or other document memorializing the rendition of judgment filed by the 268th District Court\" in connection with this case. In response, the district clerk prepared a supplemental record that contained an affidavit by the deputy clerk and a docket sheet containing two hand-written entries pertaining to January 16, 1998 and January 20, 1998. Both entries are preceded by a hand-written reference date and followed by the judge\\'s initials. The January 16th entry indicates that the appellant and the appellee appeared for trial and that the court took the matter under advisement. The January 20th entry states: \"It is the determination & Judgment of this Court that the hearing Court\\'s limitation to 5 witnesses deprived Tropicana of due process & therefore sets aside the Judgment and remands for further hearing.\" Garza contends that because the docket sheet contains the district court\\'s initialed, hand-written entry reciting the substance of the court\\'s final order before the ten-day deadline expired, the court timely rendered judgment. We disagree.',\n",
       "  \"Ordinarily, when there is a question concerning the date judgment was rendered, the date the judgment was signed prevails over a conflicting docket sheet entry. See N-S-W Corp. v. Snell, 561 S.W.2d 798, 799 (1997); Knox, 257 S.W.2d at 292-93; Grant v. American Nat'l Ins. Co., 808 S.W.2d 181, 183-84 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th dist.] 1991, no writ). In this case, the judgment was signed January 28, 1998. Because the signed judgment takes precedence over the docket sheet entry, we do not consider the docket sheet to be a timely rendition. Moreover, there is no indication that the court issued a memorandum of decision on January 20, 1998 or otherwise publicly announced rendition on that date. We conclude that neither the recital in the court's written judgment regarding an earlier rendition nor the January 20, 1998 docket sheet entry is sufficient to effectuate rendition of judgment on a date earlier than January 28, 1998, the date the court actually signed the judgment. We hold that the 268th District Court did not render judgment within the ten-day period section 11.67 mandates.\",\n",

       "  'Concluding that the expiration of the ten-day period terminated the district court\\'s jurisdiction, the court of appeals stated that \"[a]ll proceedings conducted after the expiration of the ten-day period... are void.\" 83 S.W.3d at 165. Garza argues that if he is prejudiced by the district court\\'s failure to hear and decide the appeal within ten days under section 11.67, the statute violates his constitutional rights of due process and due course of law under Texas Constitution article I, section 19 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He also contends that the court of appeals\\' interpretation of the statute violates the open-courts and separation-of-powers provisions of Texas Constitution article I, section 13 and article II, section 1. Garza argues that he met all statutory requisites for appeal to the district court and should not be penalized for the court\\'s failure to render judgment on a timely basis. The predicament Garza describes could arguably raise constitutional concerns if the district court\\'s failure to render judgment within the ten-day period precluded an opportunity for further appeal on the merits. The United States Supreme Court has held *8 that although the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a state to provide appellate review, \"[w]hen an appeal is afforded ... it cannot be granted to some litigants and capriciously or arbitrarily denied to others without violating the Equal Protection Clause.\" Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 77, 92 S. Ct. 862, 31 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1972).',\n",
       "  'Here, the district court was engaged in an eight-week jury trial when Garza filed his appeal. At the January 16, 1998 hearing, the court announced it was \"not going to be bound by any Ten-Day Rule....\"[3] Garza asserts that he had no way to control the timing of the district court\\'s rendition. Although recognizing the potential for mandamus relief, Garza argues that a mandamus proceeding would be denied as premature if filed while the district court still has an opportunity to render a timely decision. After expiration of the period, a district court\\'s judgment, even one compelled by writ of mandamus, would be void. See Cook v. Spears, 524 S.W.2d 290, 292 (Tex.1975).',\n",
       "  'As we interpret the statute, however, section 11.67 does not preclude an appeal to the court of appeals after the time for the expedited appeal to the district court has passed. The statute states that \"[t]he rules applicable to ordinary civil suits apply\" with limited exceptions detailed in the statute, \"which shall be construed literally.\" Tex. Alco. Bev.Code § 11.67(b). Section 11.67(b)(2) designates the time period for the \"trial\" in the district court. Literally construed, this provision is a limitation on the district court\\'s power to render a judgment beyond ten days. But it would go beyond the literal terms of the statute to read section 11.67(b) as divesting a license applicant of its statutory right to appeal when the court fails or refuses to act.',\n",
       "  'The statute does not clearly instruct how to perfect that appeal when the district court has not rendered a timely judgment. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code §§ 11.67(b)(4), 61.34. We assume that the Legislature did not intend to deprive a party of appellate remedies on the sole ground that the district court was unable or unwilling to perform its statutory duty. See Brady v. Fourteenth Court of Appeals, 795 S.W.2d 712, 715 (Tex.1990) (\"Statutes are given a construction consistent with constitutional requirements, when possible, because the legislature is presumed to have intended compliance with state and federal constitutions.\"). That interpretation would frustrate an express purpose of section 11.67, which contemplates that a license applicant has the right to appeal an adverse decision to the court of appeals. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code §§ 11.67(b)(4), 61.34; see also Tex. Gov\\'t Code § 2001.901 (stating that in administrative cases \"[a] party may appeal a final district court judgment ... in the manner provided for civil actions generally\").',\n",
       "  'Accordingly, we hold that if the district court fails to render judgment within the allotted time, judgment is rendered by operation of law once the ten-day appeal period expires. At that point, the district court has a ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision, which can then form the basis of an appeal. Cf. Dunn v. Dunn, 439 S.W.2d 830, 832 (Tex.1969) (court has ministerial duty to sign judgment after oral rendition); Tex. *9 R.App. P. 26.1 (requiring a signed judgment before an appeal to the court of appeals can be perfected); Tex. Alco. Bev. Code § 11.67(b) (instructing that \"[t]he rules applicable to ordinary civil suits apply\"). The appellate timetable runs from the date the district court signs the judgment, rather than from the date the judgment is rendered by operation of law. See Farmer v. Ben E. Keith Co., 907 S.W.2d 495, 496 (Tex.1995) (\"The appellate timetable does not commence to run other than by signed, written order, even when the signing of such an order is purely ministerial.\").',\n",

In Spears, the hearing on the appeal to the district court was first set forty-two days after the appeal was filed. 524 S.W.2d at 291. There the commissioner sought to set aside certain trial court orders issued after the ten-day period expired, on the ground that the district court lost jurisdiction when it failed to render judgment within ten days after the appeal was filed. Id. at 290-91. We declined to issue the writ of mandamus, stating that once the ten-day period expired, the commission\\'s order became \"final and enforceable,\" and the proceedings conducted beyond ten days \"were void because the right to a trial on appeal was lost.\" Id. at 292. Under that reasoning, any district court action taken after expiration of the ten days, including the court\\'s fulfillment of a ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the commission\\'s order, would be void.',\n",
       "  \"We did not address in Spears the issue presented here\\x97whether a district court's failure to render judgment extinguishes a party's appellate rights. Because section 11.67 makes an appeal to the district court an essential step between the administrative order and review by the court of appeals, strict adherence to the disposition in Spears would foreclose an appeal to the court of appeals when the district court fails to act timely. This Court's decision in Walker, which was decided the same year as Spears, takes the better approach.\",\n",
       "  'In Walker we cited Spears for the proposition that the applicant \"lost his right to trial on appeal,\" but we ordered the district court \"to proceed to judgment approving the order of the Commission.\" Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762-63. Implicit in that holding is an assumption that the underlying administrative judgment was affirmed when the district court did not render judgment within ten days. Nothing in Walker suggests that the license applicant lost his right to perfect an appeal in the court of appeals. Indeed, our disposition resulted in a final judgment in the district court, appealable to the court of appeals. Similarly, our decision today preserves the right to appeal the district court\\'s judgment affirming the license denial once the district court signs the judgment rendered by operation of law. We believe this disposition best reconciles the clear legislative directive to limit the time to decide an appeal in the district court with the Legislature\\'s insistence that a license applicant be afforded the right to challenge an adverse judgment in the court of appeals. We overrule Cook v. Spears only to the extent it may be read to preclude the district court from performing its ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative license denial when the district court has not rendered judgment within the deadline contained in section 11.67. Although the county judge\\'s decision was affirmed by operation of law at the end of the ten-day period, the 268th District Court has never signed a judgment in conformity with that rendition. In the absence of a valid, signed judgment, *10 the matter remains interlocutory in the district court. The court of appeals appropriately dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.

We further conclude that the statutory ten-day-trial requirement of section 11.67 does not conflict with Garza's constitutional rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions, because the district court's failure to render judgment within the statutory ten-day period does not foreclose an appeal to the court of appeals. Because the district court did not render a timely judgment within the statutory ten-day period, judgment was rendered by operation of law affirming the administrative decision. The district court retains jurisdiction to perform the ministerial duty of signing a judgment in conformity with that rendition. The appellate timetable to perfect an appeal, if any, to the court of appeals commences once that judgment is signed. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\",\n",

In answering this question, the Court acknowledges that any rendition or other ruling by the district court that occurs outside the strict ten-day period is \"void.\" 89 S.W.3d at 7.

I would hold that, if a district court does not render and sign a written judgment from which the applicant may further appeal within the ten-day period, the administrative decision is not only deemed final and enforceable but also becomes the final judgment by operation of law so that the applicant can timely perfect an appeal to the court of appeals.

Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292; see also Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762-63. In these original proceedings, the Court only considered whether mandamus should issue to preclude the district court from taking any further action after the ten-day period expired.',\n",
       "  \"In Spears, the Alcoholic Beverage Commission ordered a five-day suspension of an alcohol license. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 290. The licensee appealed to the district court under section 11.67(b)'s predecessor, article 666-15e, section 7a. Though the statute required a trial within ten days, the district court did not set the case for trial until one month later. At that time, the licensee moved for a continuance, and *12 the parties agreed to try the case another month later. On the trial date, the licensee urged two motions, one for a continuance and the other to compel the Commission to disclose certain information. The district court granted both motions but stayed the disclosure order pending the Commission's seeking mandamus relief from these rulings. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291.\",\n",
       "  'On mandamus review, the Commission argued that the district court \"lost jurisdiction\" to enter any orders, because the ten-day period for a trial on appeal had passed. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291. In discussing the legislative history of article 666-15e, this Court noted that the statute\\'s earliest version required only that an appeal be tried within ten days or at the earliest possible time thereafter \"in the event the Judge is not able to try such cause within such ten (10) day period.\" Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291 n. 2 (citations and emphasis omitted). But, in 1937, the Legislature amended the provision and struck the language permitting a judge to extend the trial beyond that ten-day period. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291; see Act of May 22, 1937, 45th Leg., R.S., ch. 448, art. I, § 15, 1937 Tex. Gen. Laws 1053, 1066. And, when the Legislature added article 666-15e to the Liquor Control Act in 1967, it declared that the statutory terms, including the ten-day trial rule, \"shall be considered literally.\" Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291; see Act of May 25, 1961, 57th Leg., R.S., ch. 262, § 1, 1961 Tex. Gen. Laws 559, 561.',\n",
       "  'Because of the Legislature\\'s repeated attempts to limit the time in which the district court could try the appeal, we concluded \"that the time for an appeal endured for ten days and that there [was] no authority to extend that time.\" Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291. Applying this conclusion to the facts, we determined that the licensee\\'s right to an appeal in the district court expired ten days after the appeal was filed. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. Moreover, we determined that any orders issued after the ten-day period, such as the district court\\'s continuance and discovery rulings, were void. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. We then determined that the Commission\\'s suspension order became the final and enforceable decision. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. Based on these conclusions, we held that mandamus relief would be \"immaterial\" and thus denied the petition. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292.',\n",
       "  \"In Cook v. Walker, the Court reached the same legal conclusion but ordered a different result. See Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762-63. In Walker, the licensee appealed an administrative order canceling his licenses. The district court stayed the suspension order pending the trial and set that trial for over a month later. Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762. The Court held that Spears governed, and therefore, the licensee lost his right to an appeal in the district court ten days after he filed the appeal. However, rather than denying mandamus relief as in Spears, the Walker Court issued mandamus relief and ordered the district court to set aside its order staying the Commission's decision and to proceed to judgment approving the Commission's order. Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 763.\",\n",
       "  \"Here, Garza contends that Spears and Walker do not apply because the district court actually heard the appeal within the ten-day period, and therefore, the district court's out-of-time judgment has full force and effect. To support his position that the district court's judgment rendered after the ten-day period is not void, Garza relies on Fox v. Medina, 848 S.W.2d 866 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1993, no writ). In Fox, the district court tried the applicant's appeal and orally rendered judgment *13 in open court within the ten-day period. However, the district court did not sign a judgment until the statutory period expired. Fox, 848 S.W.2d at 870. The court of appeals did not require the appellant to obtain a signed judgment within the ten days and, instead, held that the district court need only hear the appeal and make a decision within the ten days. Fox, 848 S.W.2d at 870. If this occurs, the court of appeals further held, the district court can sign a judgment reflecting that decision after the statutory time period expires. Fox, 848 S.W.2d at 870. The court of appeals explained that this approach precludes parties from automatically losing the district court appeal based on a deemed affirmance of the administrative decision and from losing their further appellate rights. Fox, 848 S.W.2d at 871 n. 3.\",\n",
       "  \"I disagree with Garza's contention, and Fox's conclusion, that section 11.67 allows a district court to sign a written judgment after the ten days pass to memorialize a decision that court made within the ten-day period. Accepting this position would enable the district court to disregard the statute's time limitations and indefinitely delay the case's finality for further appeal purposes. Furthermore, this result entirely contradicts our prior holding that the district court lacks jurisdiction to take any action after the ten-day period expires. See Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. Moreover, it runs afoul of the Legislature's express determination to limit the district court proceedings, which we have construed literally (as the Legislature requires) to mean the district court's power to act, to ten days. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code § 11.67(b); Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 291.\",\n",
       "  \"Consistent with our jurisprudence, I conclude that section 11.67(b) limits the district court's jurisdiction to hear the case, render judgment, and sign a written judgment for purposes of further appeal, to ten days from the date the appeal is filed. This means the district court lacks jurisdiction to render a judgment, sign a written judgment, or otherwise entertain or rule on any motions after that ten-day period expires. Consequently, any orders the district court enters after the ten-day period expires are void. Moreover, the administrative decision is deemed affirmed by operation of law once the ten-day period expires. See Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762; Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292.\",\n",
       "  'My conclusion that the district court here lacked jurisdiction to render the out-of-time judgment reaffirms Spears. However, it conflicts with Walker to the extent that, in that case, the Court issued mandamus relief to require the district court \"to proceed to judgment approving the order of the Commission.\" See Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 763. This is because, under the legal principles announced in Spears and recognized in Walker, the district court does not have jurisdiction to make any rulings\\x97including rendering judgment or signing a written judgment merely approving the administrative decision\\x97after the ten-day time period expires. Accordingly, I would disapprove of Walker and the cases that presume a district court has power to render judgment, ministerially sign a written judgment, grant a new trial, or vacate, modify or reform a judgment after the ten-day trial period expires.

       "  \"Here, because the district court lost jurisdiction over the appeal after ten days passed, the court of appeals held that it too lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal. 83 S.W.3d at 168. Garza argues that the court of appeals' interpreting section 11.67 to prohibit it from exercising jurisdiction over the appeal violates his constitutional rights of due process and due course of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 19 of the Texas Constitution. He also contends that this interpretation violates the open courts and separation of powers provisions of the Texas Constitution article I, section 13 and article II, section 1. Garza points out that he complied with all statutory requisites for the appeal to the district court and should not be penalized because that court failed to timely render judgment.\",\n",
       "  'In Spears and Walker, both mandamus proceedings, whether the district court\\'s failure to timely render and sign an appealable judgment precluded the licensee\\'s right to a further appeal in the court of appeals was not squarely before the Court. Walker, 529 S.W.2d at 762-63; Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. Instead, the Court had to determine whether mandamus should issue to preclude the district court from making rulings and rendering judgment outside the ten-day period. However, upon reviewing this issue now squarely before the Court, I agree that prohibiting a party from exercising its statutory right to a further appeal if a district court fails to render judgment within the ten-day period creates a constitutional concern. The United States Supreme Court has held that, though due process does not require a state to provide appellate review, when a state does establish an appellate right, \"it cannot be granted to some litigants and capriciously or arbitrarily denied to others without violating the Equal Protection Clause.\" Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 77, 92 S. Ct. 862, 31 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1972).',\n",
       "  'Section 11.67 does not expressly describe how a party may appeal to the court of appeals when the district court does not render and sign a judgment within the ten days. But this Court must interpret statutes in manner that renders them constitutional. Tex. Gov\\'t Code § 311.021(1); Proctor v. Andrews, 972 S.W.2d 729, 735 (Tex.1998). Consequently, I would hold that a district court\\'s failure to render and sign a judgment within the ten-day period does not prohibit a party from appealing to the court of appeals. Consistent with Spears, I would hold that the administrative decision deemed affirmed by operation of law is not only \"final and enforceable,\" but it also becomes the appealable signed final judgment necessary to perfect an appeal to the court of appeals. See Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292; see also Tex.R.App. P. 26.1. Therefore, the time in which a license applicant has to appeal to the court of appeals would run from the date the administrative decision is deemed affirmed because the district court failed to timely render and sign a judgment. This resolution best reconciles the express legislative intent that we literally construe the provision limiting the district court\\'s time to decide an appeal with the equally express legislative intent that a party have a right to appeal to the court of appeals. See Tex. Alco. Bev.Code §§ 11.67(b), 61.34(b); Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292.',\n",

Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. Moreover, under existing law, the judgment the district court signed after the ten-day period expired was void. Spears, 524 S.W.2d at 292. The legal proposition that I advocate, although consistent with our jurisprudence and the legislative intent that section 11.67 expresses, was not evident when Garza's appeal was pending in the district court or when the court of appeals dismissed the appeal. And, if Garza had the benefit of this rule when the ten-day period expired in the district court, he would have known that the administrative decision that was deemed affirmed under Spears also became the signed final judgment for purposes of perfecting an appeal. Thus, under my proposed rule, Garza would have known how to timely perfect an appeal to the court of appeals.\",\n",

For the reasons discussed above, the district court would lack jurisdiction to make any rulings in this case, and the remand to the district court here would be only for purposes of starting the timetable for Garza to perfect an appeal, if any, to the court of appeals. In other words, consistent with the rule I advocate, upon remand Garza could appeal to the court of appeals the administrative decision deemed affirmed and deemed the signed final judgment by operation of law. The remand would become effective, and the appellate time table would begin to run, after the time for filing any motions for rehearing in this Court expires. See Tex.R.App. P. 64.',\n",

See Tex. Const. art. I, § 13, art. II, § 1. Garza does not demonstrate how this construction violates any of three guarantees the open courts provision provides. See Trinity River Auth. v. URS Consultants, Inc., 889 S.W.2d 259, 261 (Tex.1994); Texas Ass'n of Bus. v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 448 (Tex.1993). Further, the cases Garza relies on are distinguishable, because they involve open courts challenges to statutes that allegedly impeded the parties' rights to bring common-law claims. See Neagle v. Nelson, 685 S.W.2d 11, 11-12 (Tex.1985); Nelson v. Krusen, 678 S.W.2d 918, 919 (Tex.1984). This case does not involve a common law claim, but only rights created under a statutory scheme.\",\n",
       "  'Similarly, Garza only contends that interpreting section 11.67 to require a hearing and rendition within ten days interferes with the district court\\'s ability\\x97not some other branch of government\\'s ability\\x97to hear and decide an appeal. Thus, Garza has not shown a separation of powers violation.

But the Court does not reconcile this holding with its *16 writing that repeatedly recognizes\\x97and declines to overrule\\x97the previous cases holding that any district court rulings or proceedings occurring outside the ten day period are void. Somehow, by designating the district court\\'s duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision as \"ministerial,\" the Court believes this magically empowers the district court with jurisdiction when none exists.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, the Court misplaces its reliance on Dunn v. Dunn to support its view that the district court retains jurisdiction after the ten-day period to ministerially sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision. Dunn v. Dunn, 439 S.W.2d 830, 832 (Tex.1969). In that case, the Court simply affirmed the validity of oral pronouncements from the bench by holding that, once a trial court orally renders judgment in open court, its entry of a written judgment is purely a ministerial act. Dunn, 439 S.W.2d at 832. The Court did not hold that a district court may sign a written judgment, even one merely affirming an administrative decision that became enforceable by operation of law, despite the district court\\'s having lost jurisdiction over the case. Nonetheless, the Court\\'s opinion here allows this result. Contra State ex rel. Latty v. Owens, 907 S.W.2d 484, 486 (Tex.1995) (\"Judicial action taken after the court\\'s jurisdiction over a cause has expired is a nullity.\") (citations omitted).',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the Court\\'s holding that the district court has authority to ministerially sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision outside the statutory time period certainly \"fixes\" Garza\\'s predicament; however, it does not resolve how future parties in Garza\\'s position may compel the district court to perform this ministerial duty. Undoubtedly, such parties who do not obtain a timely judgment through no fault of their own will be forced to file additional motions or seek relief from the appellate courts to require the district court to sign a judgment. The appellant should not bear this onerous and often costly burden.',\n",
       "  \"Finally, though the Court recognizes the Legislature's intent that the appeal in the district court be strictly confined to the ten-day period, its holding entirely disregards the rationale behind this intent expressed in the statute's plain language. Section 11.67 provides that the district court may modify or suspend the administrative decision to deny a license pending the substantial-evidence trial. Tex. Alco. Bev.Code § 11.67(b)(4). But the district court's final judgment may not be modified or suspended pending further appeal. Tex. Alco. Bev.Code § 11.67(b)(4). As the Court recognizes, this ensures that a business denied an alcohol license because of its possible danger to the public will not be able to continue operations pending that business pursuing all its appellate rights. See 89 S.W.3d at 5. However, under the Court's holding, if a district court suspends an adverse administrative decision but does not render and sign a written judgment within the ten-day period, that suspension order arguably stands and the business can continue operations until the district court decides to, or is compelled to, perform its ministerial duty.\",\n",

However, in resolving the fundamental issue presented here\\x97how a party enjoys its further appellate rights when the district court fails to timely render and *17 sign a written judgment\\x97the Court completely contradicts these legal principles, leaves questions unanswered, and thwarts the Legislature's express directive.\",\n",

The trial court found that K.C.A. was not indigent and denied K.C.A.'s motion.\",\n",
       "  '*502 The case proceeded to trial. K.C.A. was adjudicated delinquent for committing the offense of murder and ordered confined for twenty years as a child engaged in delinquent conduct. K.C.A. filed a notice of appeal and an \"Indigency Notice to the Court,\" stating that he and his family were indigent and unable to retain appellate counsel or pay costs of the appeal. K.C.A. did not file an affidavit as required by Rule 20.1. Tex.R.App. P. 20.1(a)(1). Nevertheless, the district clerk timely contested K.C.A.\\'s indigence assertion.',\n",

She also testified that she did not expect K.C.A.\\'s father to appear for the hearing because he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest.

See Tex. Fam.Code §§ 56.01(c)(1)(A), 54.03(a). Additionally, in determining whether a juvenile is indigent, the court may consider the assets and income of the child and the child\\'s parent(s), and can order a parent to pay these costs. See id. § 56.01(l),(m). Finally, section 56.02, entitled \"Transcript on Appeal,\" provides for indigent appeals as follows:',\n",

Rule 20.1, on the other hand, requires that \"the party\" must provide the information by affidavit. Tex.R.App. P. 20.1(a)(1).',\n",

Ed. 2d 87 (1994), we concluded, based on the language of Title 3 of the Family Code, that the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply when they conflict with applicable provisions of the Family Code. Here, requiring K.C.A. to file an affidavit as required by Rule 20.1 would constrict Family Code section 56.02(b)'s express allowance for the indigence determination to based on either a hearing, as in this case, or an affidavit. We conclude that because the Family Code allows an indigence finding to be predicated on either a hearing or an affidavit filed by a child's parent, a Rule 20.1 affidavit is not required, and a hearing will suffice.\",\n",
       "  'Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the rationale underlying the affidavit requirement of Rule 20.1 is not applicable in juvenile court proceedings. Rule 20.1 requires detailed affidavits in order to allow the court reporter and district clerk to decide whether to object to the filing and to prepare for that hearing. Tex.R.App. P. 20.1(b). To this end, Rule 20.1 provides that notice of an affidavit be given to the district clerk and the court reporter, allowing either of them to contest the affidavit. Id. § 20.1(d)-(e). If the party is ruled indigent, the court reporter is ordered to produce the transcript without prepayment, see id. § 20.1(j), and the rule does not expressly provide for payment unless the appealing party is subsequently able to pay. See id. § 20.1(l). In contrast, under the Family Code, the court reporter is not given any express right to object to the indigency proceeding (which occurs regardless of any contest being filed). See Tex. Fam.Code § 56.02. But the Family Code expressly provides that the court reporter will be compensated from county funds if the juvenile is found to be indigent. See id. § 56.02(c). Thus, the court reporter need not decide whether to challenge, and the rationale for applying Rule 20.1 is minimized.',\n",

The court of appeals erred in holding to the contrary. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 59.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, without hearing oral argument, the Court grants K.C.A.'s petition for review, reverses the court of appeals' judgment, and remands the case to that court for further proceedings.\"],\n",

The state trial court conducted a hearing and ordered the employees' depositions to begin on January 6, 2003. Shortly thereafter, the employees moved for reconsideration of this order and to recuse the trial judge, arguing that he was biased against attorney Jones.

A trial court\\'s discretion to impose sanctions does not depend on whether it issues a specific finding that the \"party\" \\x97 in this case, the employees \\x97 abused the discovery process.

Rather, Jones simply informed AFR that the employees would not appear on January 6, in direct violation of the court's order.

Because Mullen had not provided evidence of his expenses, the Attorney General contended that no offset could be awarded. During argument in this Court, the Attorney General retreated somewhat from this position, urging that a rough estimate of expenses during a period of excess possession might suffice in lieu of a precise accounting, but the Attorney General did not explain how those estimates should then translate into an offset.

The purpose of the press release was to explain why respondent would not be presiding in a case that was pending in the County Courts of Dallas County. The explanation related to certain allegations that an attorney in the pending case had made. In the press release, respondent stated that it was his intention to file a grievance against the attorney in connection with the allegations. Later, in response to inquiries that had been made of him, respondent sent an e-mail to approximately 100 persons, in which e-mail respondent again explained the situation and the reasons for his recusal.',\n",

On October 17, 2002, Judge Westergren signed findings of a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. On December 4, 2002, the Commission made its findings based on Judge Westergren's formal proceedings. The Commission found that respondent's press conference and e-mail violated both Article V, Section 1-a(6)(A) of the Texas Constitution[1] and Canon 2B of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.[2] The Commission issued an Order of Public Censure on January 17, 2003.\",\n",

       "  \"This case comes to us in an unusual procedural posture. Generally, an investigation of the Commission that finds merit in a complaint of judicial misconduct follows one of two paths: (1) informal proceedings, *118 in which the judge may be afforded a personal appearance before the Commission, or (2) formal proceedings before a special master. See In re Thoma, 873 S.W.2d 477, 483-84 (Tex.Rev.Trib.1994) (setting out comprehensively the procedures for handling judicial-misconduct complaints). Judges dissatisfied with the Commission's decision after informal proceedings may appeal to a special court of review composed of three courts-of-appeals justices appointed by the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. See id. at 483. The special court of review functions as a trial court, providing a trial de novo from which there is no further appeal. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 33.034(e), (i) (Vernon Supp.2003). Judges dissatisfied with the Commission's decision after formal proceedings may appeal to a review tribunal composed of seven courts-of-appeals justices appointed by the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. See In re Thoma, 873 S.W.2d at 484. The review tribunal functions as an appellate court that reviews the proceedings before the special master; further review may be sought from the Texas Supreme Court. See id.\",\n",
       "  'The procedure here is a hybrid. The Commission prosecuted respondent in formal proceedings, but respondent has sought and obtained a trial de novo before a special court of review. This raises a jurisdictional question we must first address before proceeding: Does the Texas judicial discipline system provide for a special court of review after formal proceedings? Even though no party has questioned our jurisdiction, an appellate court is obligated to determine the threshold question of jurisdiction. See Walker Sand, Inc. v. Baytown Asphalt Materials, Ltd., 95 S.W.3d 511, 514 (Tex.App. \\x97 Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied).',\n",
       "  'Viewing the charts that accompanied the publication of the Rules for Removal or Retirement of Judges, particularly Exhibit C, it appears that no appeal was contemplated from the Commission\\'s order of public censure entered after formal proceedings. See RULES FOR THE REMOVAL OR RETIREMENT OF JUDGES, 56 Tex.B.J. 823, 829-31 (1993), Exhibits A-C (reproduced at the end of this opinion). Nevertheless, section 33.034(a) of the Texas Government Code provides that \"[a] judge who receives from the commission any type of sanction is entitled to a review of the commission\\'s decision as provided by this section.\" Tex. Gov\\'t Code Ann. § 33.034(a) (Vernon Supp.2003) (emphasis added). However, \"sanction\" is defined for purposes of Chapter 33 of the Texas Government Code (entitled State Commission on Judicial Conduct) as including only a private or public admonition, a warning, a reprimand, or a requirement that a person obtain additional training or education. See Tex. Gov\\'t Code Ann. § 33.001(a)(10) (Vernon Supp.2003). Thus, \"sanction\" has a technical, legal meaning in the area of judicial misconduct that does not include \"censure.\" Indeed, \"censure\" is defined separately as an order of denunciation issued by the Commission under Article V, Section 1-a(8) of the Texas Constitution or an order issued by a review tribunal under Article V, Section 1-a(9) of the Texas Constitution. Tex. Gov\\'t Code Ann. § 33.001(a)(1) (Vernon Supp.2003). Article V, Sections 1-a(8) and 1-a(9) of the Texas Constitution refer to censure only within the context of formal proceedings, while sanctions are contemplated under Section 1-a(8) in the context of informal proceedings. Tex. Const. art. V, §§ 1-a(8), 1-a(9). Therefore, we conclude that an appeal to a special court of review is provided only after informal proceedings and not after formal proceedings resulting in a public censure.',\n",
       "  '*119 The published cases demonstrate that the practice has been consistent with the view that only special courts of review follow informal proceedings and only review tribunals follow formal proceedings. See In re Davis, 82 S.W.3d 140 (Tex.Spec.Ct.Rev.2002) (special court of review following informal proceedings); In re Jones, 55 S.W.3d 243 (Tex.Spec.Ct.Rev.2000) (same); In re Bell, 894 S.W.2d 119 (Tex.Spec.Ct.Rev.1995) (same); In re Jimenez, 841 S.W.2d 572 (Tex.Spec.Ct.Rev.1992) (same); In re Sheppard, 815 S.W.2d 917 (Tex.Spec.Ct.Rev.1991) (same); cf.

       "  \"We acknowledge that it may seem counterintuitive that a judge would have a right to appeal, by special court of review, for lesser sanctions, but have no right to appeal for the more serious censure.[3] Nevertheless, the right to appeal is not of constitutional magnitude, but is derived entirely from statute. See Rushing v. State, 85 S.W.3d 283, 285 (Tex.Crim.App.2002). That which the Legislature may withhold altogether, it may withhold in part. Id. at 285-86. Thus, our lawmakers may deny the right to appeal entirely, the right to appeal only some things, or the right to appeal all things only under some circumstances. Id. Here, the Legislature has provided an appeal by special court of review only for the Commission's sanctions assessed as a result of informal proceedings. The Rules for the Removal or Retirement of Judges have provided an appeal by a review tribunal after formal proceedings only for recommendations of removal or retirement. See TEX. R. REM'L/RET. JUDG. 12(a) (West 2003). These Rules have not provided for any appeal when the Commission recommends a public censure after formal proceedings. We do note, however, that a judge assessed a censure will have been given a public hearing before either the Commission or a special master.

Marjorie filed a petition in the trial court asserting statutory claims for damages under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Texas Survival Statute against HHC. After the trial court denied HHC's motion to compel arbitration under the TAA, HHC filed a motion to reconsider, relying on evidence that HHC was reimbursed by Medicare for services rendered to John and requesting the court to compel arbitration pursuant to the FAA. The trial court denied HHC's motion to reconsider, and HHC filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, which was denied. HHC then filed an interlocutory appeal in the First Court of Appeals pursuant to the TAA[1] and a petition for writ of mandamus in this Court pursuant to the FAA.\",\n",

See 9 U.S.C. § 2. Factors (1) and (3) are undisputed, and, because HHC was reimbursed by the Medicare program for services rendered to John, the arbitration agreement involves interstate commerce. The TAA interferes with the enforceability of the arbitration agreement by adding an additional requirement\\x97the signature of a party's counsel\\x97to arbitration agreements in personal injury cases.

Under the law of the case doctrine, the court of appeals had the authority to reconsider its first dismissal of the appeal, and to change that first decision if it was clearly erroneous.[1] However, the court of appeals should not have dismissed the second appeal for want of jurisdiction.

Briscoe filed nothing further, having already brought the question of finality to the court\\'s attention in his notice of appeal.

While courts of appeals should review trial courts\\' judgments independently to determine their own jurisdiction, we expect the parties to assist those courts when requested to do so.

Judge Alvarez then reiterated the judgment\\'s finality in his order overruling Briscoe\\'s motion for new trial.

Had Briscoe asked the court of appeals to abate the appeal and remand the case to the trial court for that limited purpose, we would not face the procedural dilemma presented today. See Tex.R.App. P. 27.2. But the quandary is not solved by the Court\\'s conclusory statement that the court of appeals\\' first opinion somehow made an undisputedly final judgment \"interlocutory.\" We should state the obvious\\x97we are making an exception in this one case because, as everyone acknowledges, Briscoe and Goodmark led the court of appeals into error during the first appeal.

The trial court determined that Texas law would apply to all claims by all members because (1) all of the Windows software license agreements and some of the DOS software license agreements chose Texas law as the governing law, and (2) the software was designed, developed, programmed, and manufactured in Dallas, shipped from there, and partially marketed there.

In Ramirez, the plaintiffs alleged that a highway median was defectively designed.[56] The court of appeals cited Rodriguez and essentially quoted its holding: \"Design of a public work, such as a state highway, is generally a discretionary function that involves numerous policy decisions, including what type of safety features to install.\"[57] But the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\\'s denial of the State\\'s plea to the jurisdiction because it concluded that the plaintiffs might be able to amend their pleadings to state a cause of action not barred by immunity.[58] We held that the court of appeals\\' refusal to dismiss the case altogether conflicted with our decision in Rodriguez.[59] That conflict did not disappear simply because the court of appeals asserted that it was following Rodriguez.',\n",

This does not mean, of course, that reliance or other elements of their causes of action cannot be proved class-wide with evidence generally applicable to all class members; class-wide proof is possible when class-wide evidence exists. But evidence insufficient to prove reliance in a suit by an individual does not become sufficient in a class action simply because there are more plaintiffs. Inescapably individual differences cannot be concealed in a throng. The procedural device of a class action eliminates the necessity of adducing the same evidence over and over again in a multitude of individual *694 actions; it does not lessen the quality of evidence required in an individual action or relax substantive burdens of proof. If a plaintiff could prove reliance in an individual action with the same evidence offered to show class-wide reliance, then the issue is one of law and fact common to the class. The question the court must decide before certifying a class, after rigorous analysis and not merely a lick and a prayer, is whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they can meet their burden of proof in such a way that common issues predominate over individual ones.',\n",

To the contrary, there is, for example, significant evidence that purchasers relied on recommendations from colleagues and others rather than any statements made directly or indirectly by Schein. The trial court did not explain in its certification order how the plaintiffs can avoid individual proof of reliance or why the necessity for such proof would not defeat the predominance requirement for certification.

There is evidence that their claim for restitution of amounts paid could be proved by Schein's records or by checks, charge slips, receipts, or other evidence of payment. It appears from the record that the determination of such amounts would be common to the class and would not require individual examination of class members except in unusual instances.\",\n",
       "  'But the same is not true for the plaintiffs\\' other damage claims. Consequential damages, for one, would obviously have to be determined class member by class member. Stromboe, for example, alleges that she \"lost time, records and production\". Unlike the restitution of amounts paid, the value of that loss cannot readily be ascertained, and Schein would be entitled to cross-examine her on the subject. The plaintiffs do not argue otherwise, nor do they appear to contend that an individual determination of consequential damages would be manageable. Rather, the plaintiffs now say on appeal that they are simply willing to forego their claims for consequential damages. They have not, however, amended their pleadings to strike that claim, and it is not clear that they could readily do so. Such an amendment *695 would be a dismissal of significant, viable claims of which potential class members may be entitled to notice under Rule 42(e).[74] Moreover, it is not clear that a class action is superior, another requirement of Rule 42(b)(4), if it necessitates that plaintiffs give up substantial rights, nor is it clear that the willingness of the five named plaintiffs to forego consequential damages is typical of the other 20,000 class members. The plaintiffs have failed to show how common issues predominate if consequential damages are to be proved, and whether a class excluding consequential damage claims could or should be certified was not explored in the trial court. Accordingly we cannot determine how they affect the question of certification.',\n",
       "  'Even if the plaintiffs could and would concede individual consequential damages without impairing the superiority of a class action, they have given no indication that they would also be willing to concede exemplary or statutory damages. The plaintiffs argue that exemplary or statutory damages can be proved without regard to individual claimants, but they have not shown how this can be done. By statute, as it pertains to this case, \"exemplary damages may be awarded only if the claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the harm with respect to which the claimant seeks recovery of exemplary damages results from ... fraud [or] malice....\"[75] Fraud, as we have said, requires proof of reliance. Malice, as defined by statute, requires proof either of specific intent or of an extreme degree of risk and a subjective awareness of it at the time.[76] In each instance, class-wide proof may be possible; it is certainly not necessary that the plaintiffs show that Schein harbored malice toward each individual class member one-on-one. But the plaintiffs here have failed to show how proof of malice can be made outside the context of class members\\' individual circumstances over time. The defendants\\' circumstances, too, may have varied over the relevant periods. Recovery of additional damages under the DTPA requires proof that the defendant acted knowingly or intentionally at the time,[77] which again appears to raise individual circumstances. Finally, any finding of the amount of exemplary damages must take into consideration the amount of actual damages.[78] It is not clear to us how exemplary or statutory damages can be determined on a classwide basis or prior to determinations of liability and actual damages.[79]',\n",

The central planning model\\x97one case, one court, one set of rules, one settlement price for all involved\\x97suppresses information that is vital to accurate resolution. What is the law of Michigan, or Arkansas, or Guam, as applied to this problem? Judges and lawyers will have to guess, because the central planning model keeps the litigation far away from state courts. (Ford asked us to certify legal questions to the Supreme Court of Michigan, to ensure that genuine state law was applied if Michigan\\'s law were to govern the whole country; the plaintiffs stoutly resisted that proposal.) And if the law were clear, how would the facts (and thus the damages per plaintiff) be ascertained? One suit is an all-or-none affair, with high risk even if the parties supply all the information at their disposal. Getting things right the first time would be an accident. Similarly Gosplan or another central planner may hit on the price of wheat, but that would be serendipity. Markets instead use diversified decisionmaking to supply and evaluate information. Thousands of traders affect prices by their purchases and sales over the course of a crop year. This method looks \"inefficient\" from the planner\\'s perspective, but it produces more information, more accurate prices, and a vibrant, growing economy.

These concerns would, perhaps, justify our interlocutory review of class-certification orders should the Texas Legislature decide to grant us jurisdiction to do so. But as it stands, the Legislature has chosen to limit our jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals like this one unless the court of appeals' decision conflicts with a prior decision of this court or another court of appeals.

The order proposed a three-phase trial plan in which the defendant's liability on various theories, including gross negligence, would be adjudicated first. Id. at 429. Phase II would address punitive damages, and Phase III would determine whether individual class members could show sufficient specific injuries or damages and whether they were proximately caused by the explosion. Id. Punitive damages determined in Phase II would then be reduced in proportion to the number of individuals who could not demonstrate actual damages or proximate cause in Phase III. Id.

In evaluating the predominance requirement for certification under Rule 42(b)(4), the court of appeals failed to consider whether common issues would predominate throughout the entire trial. Instead, the court looked at each phase separately and determined that common issues would predominate in two phases of the trial, while individual issues would only predominate in determining causation and damages. Id. at 299. Considering this showing sufficient for predominance purposes, and going so far as to suggest that separate juries could be summoned to resolve the individual issues, the court of appeals affirmed the certification order as modified.

In this case, the court of appeals did not endorse the \"certify now and worry later\" approach that the lower courts followed and we disavowed in Bernal. Instead, it affirmed based upon a detailed examination of the extensive trial court record. The record from the five-day certification hearing consists of twelve bound volumes of documents containing over 180 exhibits, and six volumes of testimony and argument. The trial court made extensive findings enumerating the issues common to the class, *703 which center around the same alleged contract breaches, the same alleged software and operational defects, the same misrepresentations, and the same scheme of sending and billing class members for unsolicited software. The court considered Schein\\'s argument that individual issues, including the determination of consequential damages, would overshadow these common issues, but concluded that the primary damage measure was disgorgement of the software\\'s purchase price, the amount of which was easily determinable from Schein\\'s own records. The court recognized that there may be other sources of consequential damages, but concluded that \"the damages issue will not require the time-consuming, individualized inquiries that Easy Dental predicts.\" 28 S.W.3d at 206. Unlike the court of appeals in Bernal, the court here considered the entire trial proceedings, made no suggestion that separate juries might be required to resolve individual damage issues, and determined that \"proof-of-claim forms, individual damage hearings, or other manageable means\" could be utilized in the event consequential damages were sought on some claims.

Page hired Mark Sepolio to remodel and expand a Houston building. Sepolio in turn hired several subcontractors, including Marton Roofing, Inc., to provide labor and materials for the project. After a dispute with Sepolio, Page terminated his contract on April 14, 1998. Page then hired six replacement contractors to finish the project. After Sepolio failed to pay Marton Roofing the full amount owned for its services, Marton Roofing sent Page a notice of its unpaid invoice on May 21, 1998, and filed a lien affidavit on June 15, 1998.',\n",

The trial court granted summary judgment in Marton Roofing's favor, awarding $26,892.75 in damages, additional prejudgment interest and attorney's fees, and foreclosure of Marton Roofing's liens against Page's property. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment on two grounds, holding (1) that Marton Roofing timely perfected a lien on Page's statutory retainage, as it filed its lien affidavit within thirty days of the time that the replacement contractors finished the project, and (2) that Marton Roofing held a valid fund-trapping lien pursuant to Texas Property Code § 53.081, 102 S.W.3d 750.\",\n",

In order to perfect a statutory retainage lien, therefore, a subcontractor must file its lien affidavit within thirty days of the time that the original contract is completed, terminated, or abandoned. Id.; Tex. Prop.Code § 53.101. Here, Marton Roofing filed its affidavit two months after the original contract was terminated, and consequently failed to perfect a lien on the statutory retainage.',\n",

Sledge, 653 S.W.2d 283, 286 (Tex.1983). Specifically, the statute provides that an owner who receives such notice \"may withhold from payments to the original contractor an amount necessary to pay the claim for which he receives notice.\" Tex. Prop.Code § 53.081(a). The statute further provides a remedy if the owner fails to withhold funds from the original contractor: \"the owner is liable and the owner\\'s property is subject to a claim for any money paid to the original contractor after the owner was authorized to withhold *735 funds under this subchapter.\" Id. § 53.084(b).',\n",

It is undisputed, however, that Page neither made nor owed any further payments to Sepolio at any time after Page received notice of Marton Roofing's claims. As with retainage liens, fund-trapping liens must be judged in relation to individual original contracts. Marton Roofing's notice authorized Page to withhold funds from Sepolio, because Sepolio was the original contractor that hired Marton Roofing. Page was not authorized to withhold funds from the replacement contractors who had no relationship to Marton Roofing. Consequently, Page cannot be liable under the fund-trapping statute for any funds paid to the replacement contractors.

Because the magistrate could not have issued the warrant in this case absent substantial facts to establish probable cause, and because the Hardys have never claimed that the State lacked probable cause or that the search warrant was invalid, we presume that the State\\'s affidavits met its probable-cause burden. See United States v. Real Prop.

III, § 47 (1876) (requiring \"[t]he Legislature [to] pass laws prohibiting the establishment of lotteries and gift enterprises in this State, as well as the sale of tickets in lotteries, gift enterprises or other evasions involving the lottery principle, established or existing in other States\"); 1 George D. Braden et al., The Constitution of the State of Texas: An Annotated and Comparative Analysis 192-94 (1977). Since 1980, the constitution has been amended several times to allow bingo, charitable raffles, and a state lottery under specified circumstances. See Tex. Const. art. III, § 47(b), (c), (d), (e). Our current constitution requires that the Legislature prohibit all lotteries or gift enterprises other than those the constitution expressly authorizes. Id. § 47(a).',\n",

       "  'any electronic, electromechanical, or mechanical contrivance designed, made, and adapted solely for bona fide amusement purposes if the contrivance rewards the player exclusively with noncash merchandise prizes, toys, or novelties, or a representation of value redeemable for those items, that have a wholesale value available from a single play of the game or device of not more than 10 times the amount charged to play the game or device once or $5, whichever is less.',\n",
       "  'Tex. Penal Code § 47.01(4)(B). In this case, the Hardys do not contend that the seized eight-liners are not gambling devices under the general definition in 47.01(4). Instead, they contend that their eight-liners fall within the exclusion provided in section 47.01(4)(B). Eight-liners fall within the statutory exclusion only if they reward players \"exclusively with noncash merchandise prizes, toys, or novelties, or a representation of value redeemable for those items.\" Id. § 47.01(4)(B). While we recognize that, in some cases, whether a machine falls within the statutory exclusion may involve a factual inquiry into the nature of the reward conferred, in this case, the pertinent facts are undisputed. The eight-liners at issue did not award prizes, toys, or novelties. They awarded tickets that could be exchanged either for gift certificates or cash to play other machines.[6] Thus, we must decide whether the tickets issued by the eight-liners in this case are representations of value that are redeemable solely for noncash merchandise prizes, toys, or novelties. We conclude they are not.',\n",
       "  'We address first whether the gift certificates issued in this case fit within the statutory exclusion. The parties agree that a gift certificate is not a toy or novelty. At issue, therefore, is whether a gift certificate, like the kind awarded here, is a \"noncash merchandise prize.\" The word \"noncash\" simply means not cash. \"Cash\" is defined either as \"ready money (as coin, specie, paper money, an instrument, token, or anything else being used as a medium of exchange)\" or \"money or its equivalent paid immediately or promptly after purchasing.\" Webster\\'s Third New Int\\'l Dictionary 346 (1961). In this case, the gift certificates were used as a medium of exchange at various retail outlets. As the court of appeals correctly noted, gift certificates, like those awarded here, are an equivalent of money; five-dollar gift certificates, redeemable for merchandise at Wal Mart, may be used in precisely the same manner as five-dollar bills. 50 S.W.3d at *132 697. Indeed, the ease with which the Game Time certificates can be converted to cash distinguishes them from five-dollar stuffed animals or other novelty items for which there is no readily marketable value. If, as here, the reward operates in the same manner as legal tender in a retail establishment, it does not qualify as a noncash merchandise prize, toy or novelty item. This interpretation comports with the plain language of the statute. Accord Texas v. del Sur Pueblo, 220 F. Supp. 2d 668, 704 n. 5 (W.D.Tex.2002) (\"The Court notes its view that gift certificates are not a noncash merchandise prize\" under section 47.01(4)(B).) (emphasis in original). Thus, because the eight-liners at issue here rewarded the players with \"cash\" or its equivalent, the machines do not satisfy the section 47.01(4)(B) exclusion.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the evidence established that a player could exchange his or her tickets for cash to be played on another machine. Players could take their tickets to an attendant who would then deposit either $1.00 or $5.00 in a machine, depending on whether the ticket was worth 100 or 500 points. This practice of exchanging tickets for cash also removes the machines from the section 47.01(4)(B) exclusion. While additional play in itself is not proscribed, when that additional play is accomplished by providing cash to play other machines, the statutory exclusion is not satisfied. The exclusion requires that the machine at issue reward the player \"exclusively with noncash merchandise prizes, toys, or novelties, or a representation of value redeemable for those items.\" Tex. Penal Code § 47.01(4)(B) (emphasis added). Under the statute, once cash is awarded, it does not matter whether the player deposited the cash directly into the machine or whether an attendant performed this task. Cash to be used for play on another machine is not a noncash merchandise prize, toy, or novelty. If tickets are exchanged for cash, regardless of whether that cash is used to play another machine, the exclusion does not apply. We leave open the possibility that additional play through some other method may not violate section 47.01(4). But in this case, the machines did not reward the players with representations of value redeemable for noncash merchandise prizes. Thus, as a matter of law, the eight-liners at issue do not meet the section 47.01(4)(B) exclusion and were subject to forfeiture or destruction as gambling devices.',\n",

Sepolio in turn hired several subcontractors, including Structural Wood Components, Inc. (Structural Wood), to provide labor and materials. Structural Wood completed its portion of the job in mid-March, 1998. As work progressed on the construction, Page made periodic payments to Sepolio totaling $270,000. Before the project was finished, however, Page and Sepolio quarreled over the work, and Sepolio requested additional funds to finish the project. Page refused, and on April 14, 1998, he terminated Sepolio's contract. Page then hired six new contractors to finish the construction. Without hiring additional subcontractors, the new contractors completed the project on July 21, 1998, for a total payment of $27,074.43.\",\n",

Structural Wood subsequently filed suit to foreclose on its lien. After a bench trial, the trial court concluded that the work was completed on July 21, 1998, when the replacement contractors finished the project. The trial court held Sepolio and Page jointly and severally liable to Structural Wood for $11,861 in actual damages plus pre- and post-judgment interest and costs. The court further ordered foreclosure of the lien on Page's property and held Page individually *722 liable for $4,000 in attorney's fees. Page appealed and the court of appeals reformed the judgment to eliminate the foreclosure order, holding that no evidence supported the trial court's finding that Page had failed to retain ten percent of the contract price as required by section 53.101 of the Property Code. 57 S.W.3d at 529. However, based on section 53.103, the court of appeals upheld the personal judgment against Page, concluding that Structural Wood would still be entitled to a lien on retained funds as long as the lien affidavit was timely filed.

Prop.Code § 53.101. These retained funds \"secure the payment of artisans and mechanics who perform labor or service,\" including subcontractors such as Structural Wood. Id. § 53.102. A subcontractor or other claimant who wants to make a claim on that retainage must properly give notice and file \"an affidavit claiming a lien not later than the 30th day after the work is completed.\" Id. § 53.103. The period during which a claimant can and must file a lien affidavit under section 53.103 is therefore the same period that an owner can and must hold retainage under section 53.101\\x97 thirty days after the completion of work. It is consequently in the best interest of all construction participants to know when the thirty-day period terminates\\x97the owner so that it can release the remaining funds, the original contractor so that it can budget for its final payment, and the claimant so that it can file the lien affidavit before that date.',\n",

Page argues that the work contemplated under a contract is necessarily completed when a contract is terminated, as no additional work is contemplated under that contract.',\n",
       "  'Structural Wood focuses on the word \"contemplated\" and counters that because the statute requires \"actual completion of the work ... reasonably required or contemplated under the original contract,\" a court should determine completion based on when all the work initially contemplated under the original contract is finished. In this case, the original contract contemplated the remodeling and expansion of the building, so the lien affidavit could be filed at any time within thirty days of the project\\'s completion. In accepting this interpretation, the court of appeals noted that the statute did not \"specify that the work only be done by the contractor who started it, as opposed to a substitute contractor.\" 57 S.W.3d at 531. Structural Wood argues that the alternative interpretation urged by Page works a hardship on subcontractors, who must file their lien affidavits in a shorter time and who may not know if an owner has terminated the general contractor. Structural Wood posits that only its approach comports with the requirement that courts interpret the mechanic\\'s lien statute liberally in order to protect lien claimants.

       "  'ten per cent (10%) of the contract price to the owner ... of such work, or ten per cent (10%) of the value of same, measured by the proportion that the work done bears to the work to be done, using the contract price or, if none, the reasonable value of the completed work as a basis of computing value.',\n",

Western Steel Co., 478 S.W.2d 786, 792 (Tex.1972), the Court interpreted this language to mean that the owner must retain ten percent of the project's cost regardless of how many individual construction contracts were awarded.

H.B. 1059, 63rd Leg., R.S. (1973). The new language added references to \"an original contract\" in the definitions of \"work\" and \"contract price.\" \"Work\" was defined as \"any construction or repair ... which is performed pursuant to an original contract,\" and \"contract price\" was defined as \"the cost to the owner for any construction or repair ... which is performed pursuant to an original contract.\" Act of May 16, 1973, 63rd Leg., ch. 96, § 2(d), 1973 Tex.

       "  'Focusing on the work initially contemplated may give a subcontractor more time to perfect a lien, but it may also greatly delay payment for contractors in general. As Justice Walker pointed out in his Hayek dissent, focusing on the entire project instead of the individual contracts means that a contractor \"who has fully performed by constructing the foundation of the building ... cannot be paid in full until 30 days after the painting contractor has finally completed the last work on the building. This may be several years after the work of the foundation contractor was completed.\" Hayek, 478 S.W.2d at 797 (Walker, J., dissenting). Under Structural Wood\\'s interpretation of the current statute, an owner who terminated a general contract before the construction project was completely finished would not have to release the ten percent retainage until thirty days after all the new contractors finished the job. Even if an economic downturn postponed completion for years, the terminated general contractor could not claim its final payment until the project was later completed. Such an indefinite delay in payment is, we believe, exactly what the Legislature was trying to prevent when it added references to \"an original contract\" in its definitions of \"contract price\" and \"work.\" See Tex. Prop.Code § 53.001(1), (14).',\n",

A subcontractor who had finished its work early\\x97for example, the subcontractor who laid the foundation for a building\\x97would take little comfort in having an extended period in which to claim a lien on the owner's retained funds if those funds were retained for many months or years.\",\n",

Under our interpretation, it is true that a subcontractor would not be able to rely on a visual examination of the worksite in order to determine whether the work has been completed. A subcontractor who viewed a half-completed project and assumed that the lien affidavit was not yet due would run the risk that the general contract had been terminated and that the affidavit deadline had passed. But mere visual examination may not be enough under either interpretation. To borrow the analogy from the Hayek dissent, even under Structural Wood\\'s interpretation a foundation subcontractor would likely have no way to know when an interior-painting subcontractor finished painting, and therefore would not know when the work contemplated by the general contract was finished. Recognizing this hardship, a recent treatise noted that \"[i]n many situations, it is difficult to ascertain when all the work is actually completed; therefore, prudent claimants will file their lien no later than 30 days after the date they have finished their own work on the job site.\" Sterling W.

However, the Legislature did not define the word \"completion\" by itself; rather, it defined the phrase \"`completion\\' of an original contract.\" Tex. Prop.Code § 53.001(15). Moreover, the Legislature specified that the term \"includ[es] any extras or change orders reasonably required or contemplated\" by the contract. Id. Thus, if the parties add additional work to the contract, the original contract will not be completed until that work is also completed.

We must not forget that the mechanic\\'s and materialman\\'s lien statutes are meant to protect the subcontractor, not the general contractor. The subcontractor is a derivative claimant,[32] and the provisions governing the claims of derivative claimants, including the retainage lien provisions, are specifically distinguished from the provisions governing the rights and remedies of original contractors.[33] There is a reason for this. A leading expert on Texas mechanic\\'s and materialman\\'s liens points out that \"[p]roperly characterizing the claimant as an original contractor or subcontractor is important because a subcontractor is not entitled to a constitutional lien, and it is relatively difficult for him to perfect a statutory lien.\"[34] There are other provisions in place to protect the general contractor.[35] \"[A]n original contractor often has a constitutional lien automatically, and the manner of perfecting his statutory lien is relatively simple.\"[36]',\n",

The provision governing notification of completion is merely permissive.[38]\",\n",
       "  \"Moreover, particularly because the owner is in the best position to know the status of his or her own contract, placing the burden of risk on the subcontractor to know if the contract has been terminated creates the potential for an unscrupulous owner to terminate the contract without notice to the subcontractor, let the thirty days run, and then contract the work out to someone else to finish, thereby relieving himself of the otherwise valid encumbrance. As we pointed out above, the purpose of the mechanic's and materialman's lien statute is to protect laborers and materialmen, not to increase their burden and risk.\",\n",

The Legislature has not required subcontractors to file their lien affidavit within thirty days of the completion of their own work; nor has the Legislature required owners to notify subcontractors if the contract with the general contractor is terminated. Absent such requirements, subcontractors must comply only with the current requirements of the statute. Those literal requirements direct lien claimants to file their liens within thirty days of actual completion of the work contemplated under the original contract.',\n",

Second, it is rather bold for the Court, nevertheless, to assert that this additional and express language in section 53.255 demonstrates that the Legislature intended that non-completion by abandonment and termination be implied within the definition of completion in section 53.001. To the contrary, it is undeniably more certain that the Legislature recognized that \"completion\" did not cover non-completion of the contract, and that it had to, therefore, expressly reference abandonment or termination in addition to actual completion in section 53.255.

       "  'First: Allstate argues that Avila failed to show that she and her attorney intended their communication regarding Dr. Samaniego to be confidential. The attorney-client privilege protects only \"confidential communications\".[2] The first problem with this argument is that, on its face, it does not make much sense. Why would Avila and her attorney not have intended the communication to be confidential when Avila and Allstate both urge that a disclosure that Avila was referred to Dr. Samaniego by her attorney would hurt her position in the case? If Avila and her attorney did not intend for his advice to be kept confidential, they were acting against their own interests. Whether they succeeded in keeping the referral confidential is one thing, but that they intended it to be kept confidential seems obvious. Allstate does not argue that the referral was disclosed to Dr. Samaniego or anyone else; she contends only that Avila and her lawyer did not intend to keep the referral confidential.',\n",

Avila\\'s attorney\\'s affidavit establishes that the communication was intended to be privileged. Allstate suggests that Avila and her attorney must have known that Dr. Samaniego would be told of the referral because \"it is common knowledge that every new patient is normally asked by a physician how she came to him\". But Allstate concedes that nothing in the record indicates what Avila may or may not have told Dr. Samaniego. Allstate argues that Avila must have known that she would have to tell Dr. Samaniego of the referral because she could not pay him at the time and he would not have consented to treat her if he were not assured of payment from her attorney. But for all we know from the record, Dr. Samaniego might have treated Avila free of charge.',\n",
       "  'As I have said, Allstate does not argue that Avila failed to show that the privilege was not waived by disclosure to Dr. Samaniego. A party who has made a prima facie showing of privilege is not required to disprove waiver of the privilege by disclosure until the issue is raised.[3]',\n",
       "  \"Second: Allstate argues that a referral to a treating physician, as contrasted with a consulting physician, is not privileged because it does not relate to the rendition of legal services. At the same time, Allstate argues that Avila's lawyer referred her to Dr. Samaniego to strengthen her damages claim. I see no basis for arguing that the attorney's referral was unrelated to his legal services in the case.\",\n",
       "  '*351 Third: Allstate argues that by testifying that she had been referred to Dr. Samaniego, Avila waived any privilege from disclosing who referred her. If that were true, then Avila should also have waived any privilege from disclosing what her attorney said in the process of the referral. Disclosure of the mere fact of referral does not waive the privilege for all related information.',\n",
       "  'Fourth: Allstate argues that Avila cannot use the attorney-client privilege offensively to conceal evidence that tends to defeat her claim for reasonable and necessary medical expenses. Allstate argues that evidence that Avila saw Dr. Samaniego because of her attorney\\'s referral and not her own physical condition tends to show that her medical expenses were not reasonable and necessary but intended merely to increase her damage claims. Offensive use is an exception to the attorney-client privilege.[4] One element of the exception is that the privileged information be such that its disclosure in a case would in all probability be determinative of the outcome.[5] Allstate argues that this requirement is satisfied by showing that disclosure would affect the outcome in some way, however slight, and that the offensive use exception does not require a showing that disclosure would defeat Avila\\'s claim altogether. I agree with the latter point, but the exception requires a showing of more than some effect. The Court explained in Republic Insurance Co. v. Davis: \"Mere relevance is insufficient. A contradiction in position without more is insufficient. The confidential communication must go to the very heart of the affirmative relief sought.\"[6] A showing that disclosure of a confidential communication would significantly affect the amount of damages awarded to a party could satisfy this requirement, but Allstate has made no such showing. Allstate argues only that disclosure of the referral would somewhat reduce the amount of medical expenses Avila might recover in damages. This argument falls short of showing that evidence of the referral goes \"to the very heart\" of Avila\\'s claim.',\n",

One of the policies sold by Casteel led to a lawsuit by policyholders against Casteel and Crown. In that lawsuit, Casteel filed a cross-claim against Crown. In this appeal from that lawsuit, we consider several issues: (1) whether Casteel, who alleges that he has been injured by the unfair and deceptive practices of Crown, has standing to sue Crown under Article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code; (2) whether that standing extends to Article 21.21 claims that allow recovery for Deceptive Trade Practices Act violations; and (3) whether the inclusion of invalid theories of liability submitted to the jury in a single broad-form question constitutes harmful error.',\n",

We also hold that submitting invalid theories of liability in a single broad-form jury question is harmful error when it cannot be determined whether the jury based its verdict on one or more of the invalid theories.

       "  'Between 1986 and 1989, Casteel sold Modified Vanishing Premium (\"MVP\") policies as an agent for Crown. The MVP policies provided that substantial premiums be paid over a short period of time, after which the premiums would \"vanish\" and the policy would carry itself through fruition by the reinvestment of policy dividends. Crown provided Casteel with information about how the policies worked, and Casteel provided biographical information on prospective clients to Crown. Crown then produced illustrations tailored to the proposed insureds, which Casteel presented as part of his sales packages. Many of Casteel\\'s clients who purchased MVP policies were friends from his church.',\n",
       "  \"Casteel's clients began complaining about the MVP policies in 1990. The premiums had not vanished as Casteel had represented and, in some cases, never would. In the case of Randall and Sandra Ferguson, Casteel sold an MVP policy that would pay $5,000,000 to the survivor in the event that one of them died. Based on Crown's projections, Casteel had initially informed them that the premiums would *382 total approximately $91,520 before vanishing, but the Fergusons later discovered that the premiums would never vanish and could total as much as $800,000. The Fergusons sued Casteel and Crown alleging DTPA, Article 21.21, and common-law causes of action.\",\n",
       "  \"Casteel filed a cross-claim against Crown alleging violations of Article 21.21, which included claims based on DTPA provisions incorporated in Article 21.21. Casteel also brought common-law claims for negligence, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and constructive fraud. Crown moved for summary judgment on Casteel's claims, and the trial court granted partial summary judgment in Crown's favor on the common-law causes of action. Casteel's Article 21.21 claims, including those based on the DTPA, proceeded to trial with the Fergusons' claims.\",\n",
       "  \"With regard to the Fergusons' claims, the jury found that both Crown and Casteel had engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices that were a producing cause of damages to the Fergusons. The jury found that Crown had committed the alleged wrongful acts knowingly and was ninety-nine percent responsible for the Fergusons' damages, while Casteel, who was found not to have acted knowingly, bore only one percent of the responsibility. On Casteel's claims against Crown, the jury found that Crown had knowingly engaged in false, misleading, unfair, or deceptive acts or practices that were a producing cause of damages to Casteel. The jury awarded Casteel $400,000 for past lost income, $1,000,000 for future lost income, $6,000,000 for past mental anguish, and $100,000 for future mental anguish. Additionally, the jury awarded Casteel attorney's fees in the amount of forty percent of his recovery.\",\n",
       "  'Following trial, Crown and the Fergusons settled. Under the settlement terms, the Fergusons assigned their rights against Casteel to Crown, so that Crown now stands in place of the Fergusons for purposes of this appeal. Crown moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Casteel\\'s claims. The trial court rendered judgment that Casteel take nothing against Crown, holding that Casteel was neither a \"person\" as defined under Article 21.21, nor a \"consumer\" under the DTPA, and therefore lacked standing to bring suit under those statutes. The court dismissed the Fergusons\\' claims against Crown with prejudice due to their settlement. The court rendered judgment on the verdict with respect to the Fergusons\\' claims against Casteel, holding Casteel individually liable for the Fergusons\\' actual damages, attorney\\'s fees, and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,366,983.',\n",

The court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor of Casteel in the amount of $1,400,000 for lost past and future income. Id. at 597. The court held, however, that Casteel was not entitled to the $6,100,000 in mental anguish damages awarded by the jury because there was legally insufficient evidence to support the award. Id. at 597. In addition, the court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the issues of settlement credit application, calculation of prejudgment interest, and attorney\\'s fees.

       "  'Crown challenges the court of appeals\\' holding that Casteel, as Crown\\'s agent, is a \"person\" with standing to sue under Article 21.21, section 16(a). Crown argues that the court of appeals erred by relying too heavily on the plain language of Article 21.21 and too little on the Insurance Code\\'s purpose. Crown acknowledges that the statute\\'s plain language grants a cause of action to \"any person\" injured by another\\'s deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance, and that \"person\" is defined broadly as \"any individual, corporation, association, partnership,... and any other legal entity engaged in the business of insurance, including agents, brokers, adjusters and life insurance counselors.\" TEX. INS.CODE art. 21.21, § 2(a) (emphasis added). Despite this language, Crown argues that standing is limited to \"persons relying on sales practices when buying policies, and the insureds and beneficiaries under those policies\\x97not the agents selling policies.\" This, Crown asserts, is because Article 21.21 has two specific, discrete purposes: (1) to protect insurance companies and their agents from \"unfair methods of competition,\" and (2) to protect the public from \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" Crown argues that \"agents\" were included in the section 2(a) definition of \"person\" only to provide them a cause of action under section 16(a) for \"unfair methods of competition,\" but not for other \"unfair and deceptive acts or practices,\" such as alleged by Casteel. See TEX. INS.CODE art. 21.21, § 16(a).',\n",
       "  \"The primary rule in statutory interpretation is that a court must give effect to legislative intent. TEX. GOV'T CODE § 312.005; see also Union Bankers Ins. Co. v. Shelton, 889 S.W.2d 278, 280 (Tex. 1994). When determining legislative intent, we look to the language of the statute, as well as its legislative history, the objective sought, and the consequences that would flow from alternate constructions. See Union Bankers, 889 S.W.2d at 280. The Legislature explicitly declared its intent in passing Article 21.21:\",\n",
       "  'The purpose of this Act is to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance... by defining, or providing for the determination of, all such practices in this state which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting *384 the trade practices so defined or determined.',\n",

Laws 2559, 2704 (current version at TEX. INS. CODE art. 21.21, § 1(a)) (emphasis added). The Legislature further admonished that Article 21.21 \"shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes.\" Id. (current version at TEX. INS. CODE art. 21.21, § 1(b)).',\n",
       "  'We do not glean from this stated purpose, nor any other language in the statute, a legislative intent to protect agents only from unfair competition. Rather, it is consistent with the Legislature\\'s express objective to regulate all insurance trade practices to conclude that an insurance agent is a \"person\" with standing to sue an insurance company when the agent is damaged by company practices that violate Article 21.21. Crown\\'s construction would allow an insurer to deceive its agent with impunity, despite knowing that the misinformation would eventually reach the public. The legislative intent does not support Crown\\'s position.',\n",
       "  \"Crown also argues that the court of appeals' holding conflicts with Allstate Insurance Co. v. Watson, 876 S.W.2d 145 (Tex.1994). In Watson, the plaintiff was injured in a car accident with Allstate's insured and sued Allstate under Article 21.21, section 16 for failing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt settlement of her claims, although the insured's liability had been reasonably established. Id. at 146. We denied standing because allowing third-party claimants standing to sue an insurer for unfair claims settlement practices would directly conflict with the well-established duties insurers owe their insureds. See id. at 150; see also Vail v. Texas Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 754 S.W.2d 129, 136 (Tex.1988). Among these duties, an insurer must defend its insured against the claims asserted by a third party. Watson, 876 S.W.2d at 150. But the claimant in Watson asked us to extend these same duties to a party adverse to the insured. Id. at 147. Allowing third parties a direct cause of action, we determined, would create situations in which an insurer would be exposed to potential liability by these conflicting duties. Id. at 150. No such conflict arises by granting Casteel standing despite his status as Crown's agent. Rather, in this case the duty owed by the insurer to the insured is in harmony with the duty owed to the agent not to misrepresent insurance policy terms. The goal of comprehensively regulating insurance practices is furthered by giving Casteel standing because it strengthens the insurer's incentive to avoid passing misleading information to the public through its agent.[1] Thus, the rationale behind Watson does not apply to Casteel's claims.\",\n",
       "  'Crown also argues that the court of appeals\\' holding conflicts with Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Garrison Contractors, Inc., 966 S.W.2d 482 (Tex.1998). In Garrison, we held that, because an employee-agent of an insurance company is a \"person\" under Article 21.21, section 2(a), the agent may be sued individually under the Insurance Code for deceptive acts or practices, despite acting within the scope of employment. Id. at 487. Crown asserts that Garrison requires us to look beyond the \"plain and common meaning\" of Article 21.21, section 2(a)\\'s definition of \"person\" to the intent and purpose of the *385 statute. We agree that we must consider the statute\\'s purpose and intent, but contrary to Crown\\'s interpretation of Garrison, a close reading of that case actually supports Casteel\\'s claim for Article 21.21 standing. In concluding that \"person\" includes an insurer\\'s employees, we declined to artificially limit the statute\\'s definition of \"person\" because that would be \"contrary to the Legislature\\'s intent to comprehensively regulate and prohibit deceptive insurance practices.\"[2]Id. at 485-87, 486. The same policy focus on comprehensive regulation that supports holding agents liable for deceptive insurance practices also supports holding that agents are \"persons\" who can sue insurers for acts prohibited by Article 21.21.',\n",
       "  'Crown next argues that Casteel cannot claim that he and Crown are, respectively, the \"person\" harmed and \"another\" who caused harm under section 16(a) because, under common-law agency principles, Casteel, as Crown\\'s agent, was Crown for purposes of the transaction at issue. Therefore, Crown urges, because Casteel cannot claim to be both Crown and someone other than Crown, Casteel does not have standing to sue Crown. We disagree.',\n",
       "  'Crown\\'s own contract with Casteel limits the application of common-law agency principles. Under their contract, Casteel is stripped of \"any power to bind the Company by making any promise, interpretation or representation.\" Furthermore, the Insurance Code itself modifies the common law when necessary to serve the Code\\'s purposes. For example, the Code specifically limits the power of an agent to bind a company to the terms of a policy. See TEX. INS.CODE arts. 21.02, 21.04. In addition, section 2(a) defines \"person[s]\" with standing to specifically include \"agents, brokers, adjusters and life insurance counselors,\" Tex. Ins.Code art. 21.21, § 2(a), all of whom may act as the common-law agents of insurance companies. This definition contains no exception limiting its application when common-law principles conflict with the Code.',\n",
       "  \"Moreover, we have acknowledged the Code's modification of common-law agency principles by holding that an agent may be personally liable under Article 21.21 for deceptive acts, notwithstanding the fact that he acted within the scope of his employment. See Garrison, 966 S.W.2d at 485. This departure from the common law serves the Legislature's purpose of comprehensively regulating and prohibiting deceptive insurance practices. See id. at 486. Crown's position defeats this purpose, because under that position no insurance company would be liable to its agent, even for direct misrepresentations, despite the agent's personal liability to consumers to whom he unwittingly passes misinformation. Common-law agency principles do not undermine the clear intent and language of the Insurance Code.\",\n",
       "  'In sum, we hold that an insurance agent is a \"person,\" as defined under Article 21.21, section 2(a), for purposes of determining standing under Article 21.21, section 16(a). Thus, when an agent meets the other required elements for a cause of action under Article 21.21, section 16(a)\\x97 sustaining actual damages caused by another\\'s engaging in an act or practice declared unfair or deceptive\\x97the agent has standing to bring that claim. This result is required by both the plain language of the statute and its legislative intent.',\n",

       "  'Casteel challenges the court of appeals\\' decision denying him standing to sue Crown under Article 21.21 for DTPA-based violations because he is not a consumer. Article 21.21, section 16(a) incorporates part of the DTPA by providing a *386 cause of action for \"unlawful deceptive trade practice[s]\" defined under DTPA section 17.46. TEX. INS.CODE art. 21.21, § 16(a); see TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.46(b) (laundry list of specific acts declared to be unlawful trade practices). Only a \"consumer\" can maintain a cause of action directly under the DTPA. TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.50(a); see Melody Home Mfg. Co. v. Barnes, 741 S.W.2d 349, 351 (Tex.1987). A \"consumer\" is defined as one \"who seeks or acquires by purchase or lease, any goods or services.\" TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.45(4). Although Casteel admits that he is not a consumer, he argues that consumer status is not required of him because his DTPA-based causes of action arise through Article 21.21, not the DTPA itself. Casteel concedes, however, that he may not have standing when a subsection of DTPA section 17.46(b) expressly requires consumer status.',\n",
       "  'While Article 21.21 incorporates the DTPA laundry list of deceptive acts, it does not incorporate the entire DTPA. TEX. INS.CODE art. 21.21, § 16(a); see Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Marshall, 724 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex.1987). Among those DTPA provisions not incorporated into Article 21.21 is the consumer standing requirement of DTPA section 17.50. See Aetna, 724 S.W.2d at 772; see also TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.50(a) (consumer-standing requirement). Thus, we have held that consumer status is not specifically required to bring a DTPA-based cause of action under Article 21.21. See Aetna, 724 S.W.2d at 772. But if the terms of a subsection of DTPA section 17.46(b) require consumer status, then consumer status is required to bring an action under Article 21.21 for its violation. See Transport Ins. Co. v. Faircloth, 898 S.W.2d 269, 273-74 (Tex.1995); Webb v. International Trucking Co., 909 S.W.2d 220, 227 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1995, no writ).',\n",
       "  'As part of his Article 21.21 claim, Casteel alleged that Crown violated DTPA sections 17.46(b)(5), (7), (9), (12), and (23). In Faircloth, we stated that DTPA section 17.46(b)(23), as incorporated in Article 21.21, requires consumer status. Faircloth, 898 S.W.2d at 274. DTPA section 17.46(b)(23) creates a cause of action for \"the failure to disclose information concerning goods or services ... intended to induce the consumer into a transaction.\" TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.46(b)(23) (emphasis added). We held that DTPA section 17.46(b)(23) requires consumer status by its terms because it explicitly arises out of a \"consumer\" transaction, and because it creates a cause of action for the failure to disclose information concerning \"goods or services.\" See Faircloth, 898 S.W.2d at 273. We stated that \"goods\" and \"services,\" as defined under the DTPA, must be \"purchased or leased for use\" by the party seeking to state a cause of action. Id. at 274. For example, although the plaintiff in Faircloth brought suit to recover on a policy to which she was not a party (the policy being a \"good or service\" to the insured), we held that third parties negotiating a policy settlement \"do not seek to purchase or lease any of the services of the insurer.\" Id. Because the policy was not a \"good or service\" to the nonconsumer plaintiff, she did not have standing. Applying Faircloth`s reasoning to all DTPA claims based on Article 21.21, Casteel must be a consumer to state a cause of action under Article 21.21 for the violation of a DTPA subsection if the subsection either (1) specifically involves a consumer transaction, or (2) involves the misrepresentation of \"goods or services\" acquired by the plaintiff. Id. at 273-74; see Webb, 909 S.W.2d at 228 (rejecting nonconsumer\\'s Article 21.21 claim for violation of DTPA section 17.46(b)(5) because plaintiff did not acquire \"goods or services\").',\n",
       "  'Accordingly, Casteel\\'s Article 21.21 claims for violations of DTPA sections *387 17.46(b)(5),[3] 17.46(b)(7),[4] and 17.46(b)(9)[5] require consumer status because they too deal with the misrepresentation of \"goods or services.\" TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 17.46(b)(5), (7), and (9). Casteel\\'s claims arise from Crown\\'s alleged misrepresentations of policy illustrations prepared by Crown and presented by Casteel to his clients. Casteel did not acquire or seek to acquire the policies; he was merely the conduit for information. Thus, the misinformation at issue does not concern \"goods or services\" purchased or leased by Casteel. Rather than goods or services, Crown\\'s alleged misrepresentations to Casteel involve internal product information for Casteel\\'s use in the sales of policies. We hold that because Casteel is not a consumer of Crown\\'s goods and services, he cannot state a cause of action under Article 21.21 for the violation of DTPA subsections 17.46(b)(5), (7), (9), and (23), which, by their terms, require consumer status.',\n",
       "  'Lack of consumer status, however, does not bar Casteel from bringing a cause of action under Article 21.21 for Crown\\'s violation of DTPA section 17.46(b)(12).

When brought as a claim under Article 21.21, this subsection does not require consumer status because it neither arises out of a consumer transaction explicitly, nor deals with the misrepresentation of \"goods or services.\" See Webb, 909 S.W.2d at 228. We therefore reverse the court of appeals\\' judgment that Casteel cannot bring any DTPA-based Article 21.21 actions against Crown, and hold that Casteel is not required to be a consumer to bring an Article 21.21 claim for the violation of DTPA section 17.46(b)(12).',\n",

It is fundamental to our system of justice that parties have the right to be judged by a jury properly instructed in the law. Yet, when a jury bases a finding of liability on a single broad-form question that commingles invalid theories of liability with valid theories, the appellate court is often unable to determine the effect of this error. The best the court can do is determine that some evidence could have supported the jury\\'s conclusion on a legally valid theory. To hold this error harmless would allow a defendant to be held liable without a judicial determination that a factfinder actually found that the defendant should be held liable on proper, legal grounds. See Muldrow & Underwood, Application of the Harmless Error Standard to Errors in the Charge, 48 BAYLOR L.

Accordingly, we hold that when a trial court submits a single broad-form liability question incorporating multiple theories of liability, the error is harmful and a new trial is required when the appellate court cannot determine whether the jury based its verdict on an improperly submitted invalid theory. See TEX.R.APP. P. 61.1 (\"No judgment may be reversed on appeal ... unless the Supreme Court concludes that the error complained of ... probably prevented the petitioner from properly presenting the case to the appellate courts.\"); see also TEX.R.

If they are not, the appellate court must, at a minimum, be able to determine whether properly submitted theories constituted the basis of the jury's verdict. Here, four of the thirteen theories in the single liability question were improperly submitted because they required that Casteel be a consumer. Yet the language of these theories was altered to remove any reference to their consumer-status requirements. Thus, the jury was confronted with four liability theories available only to consumers, but was given no indication that Casteel was required to be a consumer to succeed under any of them. Given these facts, it is possible that the jury based Crown's liability solely on one or more of these erroneously submitted theories. At any rate, it is impossible for us to conclude that the jury's answer was not based on one of the improperly submitted theories.\",\n",
       "  'Although we have not considered this issue since we adopted the harmless error doctrine, we have previously held that submitting multiple independent liability theories in a single jury question is harmful when one of the theories is invalid and it cannot be determined whether liability was based on the invalid theory. See Lancaster v. Fitch, 112 Tex. 293, 246 S.W. 1015, 1016 (1923). In Lancaster, the trial court submitted a single general negligence issue with instructions regarding three distinct theories of negligence liability. Id. at 1015-16. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. On appeal, the defendant established that the trial court should not have submitted one of the theories. The court of appeals nevertheless concluded that the error was harmless because the jury could have based its verdict on either of the properly submitted theories. We disagreed, reasoning:',\n",
       "  'The jury may have found for [plaintiff] on each of the two issues properly submitted. On the other hand, as authorized by the pleading and the charge of the court, they may have found for [plaintiff] only on the issue that was improperly submitted. In order for courts to be able to administer the law in such cases with reasonable certainty and to lay down and maintain just and practical rules for determining the rights of parties, it is necessary that the issues made and submitted to juries, and upon which they are required to pass, be authorized and supported by the law governing the case.',\n",
       "  'Id. at 1016.',\n",
       "  \"Today, we reaffirm this reasoning. When a single broad-form liability question erroneously commingles valid and invalid liability theories and the appellant's objection is timely and specific, the error is harmful when it cannot be determined whether the improperly submitted theories formed the sole basis for the jury's finding. We disapprove of those courts of appeals' decisions holding that this error is harmless if any evidence supports a properly submitted liability theory. See Provident, 914 S.W.2d at 277-78; Hart, 881 S.W.2d at 511; Bernstein, 850 S.W.2d at 702; Pool, 688 S.W.2d at 882.\",\n",

See City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 752 (Tex.1995) (\"Submission of an improper jury question can be harmless error if the jury\\'s answers to other questions render the improper question immaterial.\"); Boatland of Houston, Inc. v. Bailey, 609 S.W.2d 743, 749-50 (Tex.1980) (holding that the potentially improper submission of defensive issues was harmless error when the jury also found for the defendant on independent grounds).',\n",
       "  'Casteel argues that Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 277 required the trial court to submit all liability theories in a single broad-form question, and that the verdict should not be overturned because the trial court simply followed that rule. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 277. Rule 277 states, *390 \"In all jury cases the court shall, whenever feasible, submit the cause upon broad-form questions. The court shall submit such instructions and definitions as shall be proper to enable the jury to render a verdict.\" Id.',\n",
       "  'Rule 277 is not absolute; rather, it mandates broad-form submission \"whenever feasible.\" See Westgate, Ltd. v. State, 843 S.W.2d 448, 455 n. 6 (Tex.1992). In Westgate, we noted that \"[s]ubmitting alternative liability standards when the governing law is unsettled might very well be a situation where broad-form submission is not feasible.\" Id. Similarly, when the trial court is unsure whether it should submit a particular theory of liability, separating liability theories best serves the policy of judicial economy underlying Rule 277 by avoiding the need for a new trial when the basis for liability cannot be determined. Furthermore, Rule 277 mandates that \"[t]he court shall submit such instructions and definitions as shall be proper to enable the jury to render a verdict.\" TEX.R. CIV. P. 277. It is implicit in this mandate that the jury be able to base its verdict on legally valid questions and instructions. Thus, it may not be feasible to submit a single broad-form liability question that incorporates wholly separate theories of liability.',\n",

After the jury returned its verdict, Crown settled with the Fergusons in exchange for the dismissal of their claims against Crown and an assignment of the Fergusons' rights with regard to their claims against Casteel. The trial court then rendered judgment for the Fergusons (in whose shoes Crown now stands) against Casteel in the amount of $1,366,983 for actual damages, attorney's fees, and prejudgment interest. Casteel does not dispute his joint and several liability for this amount.[8] The court of appeals held that, under the one satisfaction rule, Casteel is entitled to a dollar-for-dollar credit for the settlement amount Crown paid the Fergusons, which Crown stipulated was at least $1,366,983. 3 S.W.3d at 591.\",\n",
       "  'Under the one satisfaction rule, a plaintiff is entitled to only one recovery for any damages suffered. See Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex.1991). This rule applies when multiple defendants commit the same act as well as when defendants commit technically different acts that result in a single injury. Id. Here, Crown and Casteel committed technically different acts *391 that caused the Fergusons to suffer a single financial injury.',\n",
       "  'Crown argues that the settlement should not be credited against the judgment rendered against Casteel for damages Crown and Casteel jointly caused; rather, the settlement should first be credited against damages that Crown would have been solely responsible for had no settlement been reached. Because the jury found that Crown acted knowingly, the Fergusons would have been entitled to recover additional damages from Crown had judgment been rendered against Crown. Crown contends that the settlement credit must be subtracted from the total judgment that would have been rendered against Crown and Casteel, which includes joint and several damages as well as the additional damages for which Crown is separately liable, otherwise the Fergusons would not receive full satisfaction for their injury.',\n",
       "  'This case presents an unusual situation for applying the one satisfaction rule. Normally, claims against the settling party are dropped before the jury returns a verdict, so the amount of sole damages that the settling party is potentially liable for is rarely determined. Thus, a court usually considers only the judgment against the nonsettling defendant in applying a settlement credit. Here, Crown settled after a verdict had been returned that would have held Crown solely liable for additional damages. Crown contends that, without the settlement, the judgment that would have been rendered against Crown and Casteel is $8,201,989.01. Crown argues that, under Stewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1 (Tex.1991), a court should first treble the damages and calculate the total judgment due to the plaintiffs and then subtract any settlement amount to determine how much is still owed by the nonsettling defendant. Crown argues that Casteel is not entitled to any reduction in the $1,366,983 judgment against him because he has not shown that the total judgment of $8,201,898.01 less the settlement amount leaves less than $1,366,983, and therefore he has not shown that the Fergusons would be recovering more than the amount awarded by the jury (i.e., more than one satisfaction).',\n",
       "  \"Crown's reliance on Stewart Title is misplaced. In that case, treble damages were awarded against the nonsettling defendant, not the settling defendant. To effectuate the punitive purpose of treble damages, the Court held that the damages awarded against the nonsettling defendant must be trebled before applying the settlement credit. Stewart Title, 822 S.W.2d at 9. Thus, the facts of Stewart Title are inapposite. When a defendant settles after a jury verdict is returned but before a judgment is entered, the court should not apply the settlement credit to the judgment that would have been rendered against the settling defendant in determining the credit amount. Instead, the court should look to the judgment to be rendered against the nonsettling defendant and apply established principles governing settlement credits.\",\n",

Under the one satisfaction rule, the nonsettling defendant may only claim a credit based on the damages for which all tortfeasors are jointly liable. Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78; Paschall v. Peevey, 813 S.W.2d 710, 712 (Tex.App.-Austin 1991, writ denied); Hill v. Budget Fin. & Thrift Co., 383 S.W.2d 79, 81 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1964, no writ) (\"[A] plaintiff must only give credit to a non-settling defendant for that part of the damages ... receive[d] from settling defendants that are applicable to all equally.\"). A nonsettling defendant cannot receive credit for settlement amounts representing punitive damages. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927 (citing Hill, 383 S.W.2d at 81; Howard v. General Cable Corp., 674 F.2d 351, 358 (5th Cir.1982), and Paschall, 813 S.W.2d at 712). Thus, consistent with Garrett and Ellender, the nonsettling defendant is entitled to offset any liability for joint and several damages by the amount *392 of common damages paid by the settling defendant, but not for any amount of separate or punitive damages paid by the settling defendant.',\n",
       "  \"Applying these principles, Casteel is entitled to a credit for any settlement amount representing joint damages that Crown paid the Fergusons. Casteel offered proof that the settlement amount was at least $1,366,983\\x97the amount of the judgment against him. At that point, it was the plaintiffs' (now Crown's) burden to offer evidence allocating the settlement between actual damages, for which Crown and Casteel were jointly liable, and additional damages, for which only Crown was liable, in order to limit the credit to amounts representing actual damages. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 928. Casteel is entitled to an offset equal to the amount Crown paid in settlement of joint damages. Because the settlement was entered and judgment was rendered before our decision in Ellender, we would normally remand this issue to the trial court to allow Crown to prove the settlement allocation. See id. at 928-29. However, Crown has fully released its judgment against Casteel and has supplemented the record with a copy of the executed release of judgment and judgment lien. Crown's action moots the settlement credit issue. Accordingly, because Crown has released the judgment against Casteel, we grant Crown's Motion to Supplement the Record and vacate that part of the court of appeals' judgment remanding to the trial court to apply the settlement credit. Crown argues that we should vacate the portion of our opinion concerning settlement credits because the issue is moot. But settlement or release does not automatically require vacating an opinion. See Houston Cable TV, Inc. v. Inwood West Civic Ass'n, 860 S.W.2d 72, 73 (Tex.1993). Therefore, we will not vacate our opinion.\",\n",

The City then filed a declaratory judgment action against the News seeking a declaration that the requested documents were not public information subject to disclosure under the Act. The News counterclaimed against the City and the city manager in his official capacity, seeking a writ of mandamus requiring the City to disclose the requested documents.

(1995) (\"The requestor of a public record should never have to defend such a suit.\"); SENATE COMMITTEE ON JURISPRUDENCE, BILL ANALYSIS, Tex. S.B. 636, 74th Leg., R.S. (1995) (\"The possibility of being sued as a result of making an open records request may limit the number of future requests.\"). The 1995 amendment, which became effective on September 1, 1995, bolsters the City\\'s argument that the Act, as it existed in 1993, did not prevent the City from seeking a declaratory judgment against the News. Therefore, we conclude that the City was entitled to bring a declaratory judgment action against the News.',\n",
       "  'B. INFORMATION SUBJECT TO THE ACT',\n",
       "  \"The City argues that the memorandum is not subject to the Act. The City asserts that the city manager drafted the memorandum purporting to terminate the city finance director but never finalized or sent the memorandum to the finance director. Therefore, the City argues, the memorandum was just a draft and is not public information under section 552.022 of the Act. The City also argues that the memorandum was not used in connection with transacting official business and, therefore, is not public information under section 552.021. But the City concedes that the city manager prepared the memorandum to circulate to the city council in order to consult with them about the city finance director. The City further explains that, after consultation, the city manager decided not to pursue the strategy outlined in the memorandum and, thus, did not finalize the memorandum to send to the finance director. The News argues that the Act does not require that documents be final to be public information and that the city manager's own affidavit proves that the memorandum was used in transacting official business. We agree with the News that the memorandum is public under the Act.\",\n",
       "  'Under the Act, public information is any information which, \"under a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction official business, is collected, assembled, or maintained by a governmental body; or for a governmental body and the governmental body owns the information or has a right of access to it.\" TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.021. Section 552.022, \"[w]ithout limiting the meaning of other sections of [chapter 552],\" provides specific categories of public information. TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.022. These categories include *359 \"a completed report, audit, evaluation, or investigation.\" See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.022. But section 552.022 emphasizes that its categories do not limit the meaning of the Act\\'s other sections. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.022. Therefore, section 552.022\\'s categories do not limit section 552.021\\'s broad definition of public information. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE §§ 552.021, 552.022. Accordingly, we hold that a document, even if labeled \"draft,\" is public information if, under a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business, it is collected, assembled, or maintained by or for a governmental body. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.021. It follows that a draft document that is not collected, assembled, or maintained by or for a governmental body under a law or ordinance or in connection with transacting official business is not public information. For example, the mere creation of a draft is not transacting official business. But if the draft document is used in connection with transacting official business, then the draft document becomes public information. To allow a governmental body to exempt otherwise public documents from the Act simply by labeling or calling them \"drafts\" would invite governmental bodies to circumvent the Act\\'s purpose of broad public access to governmental information. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.001.',\n",
       "  \"The City does not argue that it did not collect, assemble, or maintain the memorandum. The City argues that because the memorandum was never finalized and sent to the finance director, it was a mere draft that was not used in transacting official business, and therefore, is not public under the Act. This argument is without merit. By the City's own admission, the city manager and city council used the memorandum in connection with transacting official business. The city manager's affidavit states, in part:\",\n",
       "  'I drafted the document with the intention of providing it to the Garland City Council in a closed executive session, and to the City Attorney, for the purpose of discussing it with them to obtain their advice, opinion and recommendation on both the language to be used, as well as whether to pursue the strategy where the document would be used at all. The document was prepared by me to elicit the advice and input of the City Council and me in my decision on how to resolve the employment matter.... Following the deliberations between the Garland City Council and myself, and Garland City Attorney and myself, I determined not to resolve the employment matter in the manner where use of document might have been necessary to put the document in final form, nor did I authenticate it by signing or sending it to its contemplated addressee.',\n",
       "  \"Despite the fact that the City now calls the memorandum a draft and that the city manager addressed the memorandum to the finance director, the city manager concedes that he prepared the memorandum to circulate to the city council and then used it to consult with them about the City's personnel problem with the finance director. The memorandum became public information under the Act when the city manager and the city council used it in deciding how to handle the problem with the finance director, a decision involving the City's official business. See TEX. GOV'T CODE § 552.021. Accordingly, we conclude that the memorandum is public information under section 552.021.\",\n",
       "  'C. The Deliberative Process Privilege',\n",
       "  \"Having determined that the memorandum here is public information under the Act, we now consider whether the memorandum is exempt from required disclosure. The City argues only that the memorandum is exempt from disclosure under section 552.111, the agency memoranda exception. See Tex. Gov't Code § 552.111. The City does not assert any other exception. See TEX. GOV'T CODE § 552.101-.123. Section 552.111 exempts documents that would not be available to those in litigation with an agency. See TEX. GOV'T CODE § 552.111. The City contends *360 that section 552.111 incorporates the deliberative process privilege, which protects the memorandum from disclosure because the memorandum is predecisional and, although it does not reflect deliberations on its face, it was used in the deliberative process. The City also asserts that the court of appeals erred in holding that the privilege does not protect the memorandum on the ground that the memorandum was not used in the City's policymaking process.\",\n",
       "  \"The News argues that there is no deliberative process privilege in Texas. In the alternative, the News argues that the court of appeals correctly refused to apply the deliberative process privilege to the memorandum because the privilege protects only documents reflecting policy formulation and that the memorandum at issue deals with a mere personnel matter. Whether the deliberative process privilege exists in Texas and, if it does, the privilege's scope, are issues of first impression for this Court.\",\n",
       "  'Section 552.111 exempts from disclosure \"[a]n interagency or intraagency memorandum or letter that would not be available by law to a party in litigation with the agency.\" TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.111. Texas courts and the Attorney General have consistently recognized that this exception encompasses the common law deliberative process privilege, which protects certain agency communications from discovery.[4]See Lett, 917 S.W.2d at 456; Texas Dep\\'t of Pub. Safety v. Gilbreath, 842 S.W.2d 408, 412-13 (Tex.App.-Austin 1992, no writ); Austin v. City of San Antonio, 630 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1982, writ ref\\'d n.r.e.); Tex. Att\\'y Gen.

Indeed, section 552.111\\'s language is almost identical to the FOIA\\'s agency memoranda exception. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)(exempting \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency\"). Federal courts have consistently held that the FOIA\\'s agency memorandum exception includes the deliberative process privilege, as well as the attorney work-product and attorney-client privileges.[5]See National Labor Relations Bd. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975); Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 862 (D.C.Cir.1980).

See Blackmon v. Hansen, 140 Tex. 536, 169 S.W.2d 962, 964-65 (1943). Therefore, we hold that section 552.111 of the Act incorporates the deliberative process privilege.',\n",
       "  'The next issue we consider is whether the deliberative process privilege is properly limited to communications that reflect policymaking. In determining this issue, we again look to federal case law for guidance. See Blackmon, 169 S.W.2d at 964-65. A few months before the Texas Legislature enacted the predecessor to the Public Information Act, the Open Records Act, the United States Supreme Court explained the purpose and scope of the *361 FOIA\\'s agency memoranda exception. See Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 85-91, 93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1973). The Court explained that the FOIA\\'s agency memorandum exception, which exempts agency communications falling under the attorney work-product and attorney-client privileges in addition to the deliberative process privilege, was designed to promote \"`frank discussion of legal and policy matters.\\'\" Mink, 410 U.S. at 87, 93 S. Ct. 827 (quoting S. REP. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965)). The Court noted that, in enacting the agency memoranda exception, Congress recognized that the \"efficiency of Government would be greatly hampered if, with respect to legal and policy matters, all Government agencies were prematurely forced to `operate in a fishbowl.\\'\" Mink, 410 U.S. at 87, 93 S. Ct. 827 (quoting S. REP. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965)). Nevertheless, because of the FOIA\\'s strong policy favoring disclosure, Congress intended that the agency memorandum exception be construed \"as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government operation.\" Mink, 410 U.S. at 87, 93 S. Ct. 827 (quoting S. REP. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965)); see also Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 868.',\n",

Ct. 1504 (quoting Davis, The Information Act: A Preliminary Analysis, 34 U. Chi. L.Rev. 761, 797 (1967)). Thus, when the Texas Legislature enacted the Public Information Act, including the agency memorandum exception, the United States Supreme Court had described the FOIA\\'s agency memorandum exception as including the attorney work-product and attorney-client privileges to protect communications about legal matters and a deliberative process privilege to protect communications about policy matters.',\n",

In support of its argument, the City cites cases that do not expressly limit the privilege to policy matters, but apply the privilege to documents because the documents are predecisional and deliberative.

The Fourteenth Court of Appeals held that documents prepared by school personnel pertaining to a student's performance at school were not exempt because they merely implemented existing policy and did not contribute to policy formulation. See Lett, 917 S.W.2d at 457. The Attorney General ruled that documents relied upon by the Department of Public Safety in deciding not to promote an individual were not exempt because they were internal administrative or personnel matters that did not involve the Department's policymaking function.

In contrast, the Attorney General ruled that section 552.111 excepted from disclosure a report that a university had solicited about the university's alleged systemic racial discrimination against faculty members.

Such an interpretation would allow the exception to swallow the Act. Thus, we cannot interpret the exception so broadly. Unlike the FOIA, our Act contains a strong statement of public policy favoring public access to governmental information and a statutory mandate to construe the Act to implement that policy and to construe it in favor of granting a request for information.

The City argues that the Act\\'s plain language does not support a compelling-demonstration requirement but merely imposes a presumption, shifting the burden of production to the governmental body on whether the requested information can be withheld. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.302. The court of appeals agreed with the City. Because we determine that the City did not meet its burden to prove that the memorandum is not subject to the Act or falls within one of the Act\\'s exceptions to public disclosure, we need not decide whether the City must go beyond that to make a compelling demonstration that the information is not subject to public disclosure.[9]',\n",

Drawing the line where the dissent draws it is drawing no line at all. Instead, we hold that the deliberative process privilege as incorporated in the agency memoranda exception protects only those documents involved in policy formulation.',\n",
       "  \"The dissent cites federal cases as support for its proposition that the privilege covers documents used in personnel deliberations and other federal cases that apply the privilege to documents that do not relate to policymaking. But we have already acknowledged most of these cases and explained that they do not answer the issue we decide today\\x97whether the deliberative process privilege is properly limited to agency communications reflecting policy formulation. Rather, these cases focus on whether the document at issue is predecisional and deliberative. See, e.g., May, 777 F.2d at 1015 (deciding that Air Force Lieutenant Colonel promotion recommendation reports were predecisional and deliberative); Russell, 682 F.2d at 1048 (determining that a draft historical document on herbicide use during the Vietnam War was part of a deliberative process, and therefore, protected from disclosure). We do acknowledge that American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v.

See AFGE, 907 F.2d 203, 207 (D.C.Cir.1990).\",\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, the scope of the agency memoranda exception in Texas is a case of first impression in this Court. Thus, we are not wedded to any particular interpretation of the privilege. And, again, when the Texas Legislature adopts a federal statute, we presume that it knew of the federal courts\\' construction of the federal statute when it adopted the statute and intended to adopt that construction. See Blackmon, 169 S.W.2d at 964-65. When the Legislature enacted the Texas Public Information Act in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court had just issued Mink, in which it explained that the FOIA\\'s agency memoranda exception was designed to promote the frank discussion of legal and policy matters.

The Court also noted that Congress intended that the exception be construed \"as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government operation.\" Mink, 410 U.S. at 87, 93 S. Ct. 827. The dissent also relies on Mink but misconstrues it. The dissent correctly notes that the previous version of the FOIA\\'s agency memoranda exception was criticized because it would permit compelled disclosure of an otherwise private document simply because the document did not deal \"solely\" with legal or policy matters. See Mink, 410 U.S. at 90, 93 S. Ct. 827. But the Mink court explained that the criticism was directed at the problem of \"disclosure of ... policy recommendations simply because the documents containing them also happened to contain factual data.\" See Mink, 410 U.S. at 90, 93 S. Ct. 827 (\"Documents dealing with mixed questions of fact, law, and policy would inevitably, under the proposed exemption, become available to the public.\").',\n",
       "  'Further, earlier interpretations of the deliberative process privilege limited it to documents reflecting policymaking. In 1967, Professor Davis noted that a proper construction of the exception called for \"disclosure of all opinions and interpretations *366 which embody the agency\\'s effective law and policy, and the withholding of all papers which reflect the agency\\'s group thinking in the process of working out its policy and determining what its law shall be.\" Davis, The Information Act: A Preliminary Analysis, 34 U.

But cases under the [FOIA] have extended the privilege to budget requests, presentence reports to federal judges, summaries of the testimony of witnesses at a public hearing, I.R.S. secret policies and efforts to cover-up political interventions by members of Congress in the problems of individual taxpayers, and routine application of agency policy.\",\n",

Our Public Information Act mandates that we liberally construe it to further the policy of providing public access \"to complete information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\" Tex. Gov\\'t Code § 552.001. It also mandates a construction favoring a request for information. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 552.001; A & T Consultants, 904 S.W.2d at 676. Given the Legislature\\'s mandate, we should not blindly follow the federal courts in their expansion of the privilege.',\n",

Further, since the early 1990s, the Texas Attorney General has interpreted the deliberative process privilege to except only documents involving policymaking, and although the Legislature has amended the Act each session since then, the Legislature has never responded negatively to the Attorney General's interpretation of the privilege.

The plurality concludes that since the examples given in section 552.022 do not limit the meaning of other sections in the chapter, a draft document is public information. But in no other area of statutory interpretation would we conclude that the legislature has written a completely irrelevant list of examples into the statute. One of the examples of public information is \"a completed report, audit, evaluation, or investigation.\"[1] In my opinion, this example draws a distinction between documents collected, maintained, or assembled by a governmental body and documents that a governmental body owns or has a right of access to. I would emphasize that to be public information, the memorandum generated by the city manager has to be completed. And in this case what makes it completed is that the city manager presented it to the city council for decision and it was used by the council in making a decision on the problem with the finance director. Consequently, the memorandum is public information.',\n",

Antitrust and Title VII cases are examples.[2]',\n",

Those decisions explain some of the history of the deliberative process exemption that is set forth in section 5 of the federal Freedom of Information Act.

The federal common law had long recognized the need for frank exchanges among government officials in many of their deliberations. Accordingly, as Grumman instructs, the deliberative process privilege in exemption 5 of the federal Freedom of Information Act carves out documents considered in making a decision but that do not reflect the actual decision.

At times, a division of the national Board also made recommendations to the entire Board in the form of Division Reports. Although the national Board sometimes followed the recommendations of the Regional Board Reports or the Division Reports without expressing whether it agreed with the reasoning of those decisions, the Supreme Court held that both the Regional and the Division Reports were within exemption 5 under the FOIA because they were part of the deliberative process.

The Buys decree provided that all property not specifically allocated in the divorce decree was granted to the wife. See Buys, 924 S.W.2d at 370. We first recognized that an express residuary clause is effective to award property under Texas law even if the clause does not list a particular asset by name. See Buys, 924 S.W.2d at 372. Because the Buys residuary clause treats the retirement benefits, the decree satisfies the Amendment\\'s requirements. See Buys, 924 S.W.2d at 374.

Congress did not provide that treatment by operation of state law is enough to satisfy the statute and allow a later partition suit. See 10 U.S.C. § 1408(c)(1). The court of appeals reasoned that Texas law operates to convert community property into a tenancy in common. The court noted that this changes the nature of the asset and thus held that the asset is treated under the Amendment. The court further relied upon the definition of \"treat\" to determine if the Act would allow subsequent partition of the military benefits. The court of appeals did not consider that the Amendment expressly requires that the decree itself treat the asset. See 10 U.S.C. § 1408(c)(1).

The United States Supreme Court held that section 1408 preempted state law and noted that the law is both precise and limited. See Mansell, 490 U.S. at 588, 109 S. Ct. 2023. Thus, the Act grants state courts only limited authority to allocate military retirement benefits. See Mansell, 490 U.S. at 588, 109 S. Ct. 2023; see also Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572, 581, 99 S. Ct. 802, 59 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (holding that in allocating a federal entitlement, Congress may preempt state family law by direct enactment). Because the Act preempts state law and expressly limits a state court\\'s ability to allocate military retirement benefits in pre-1981 divorces, we hold that McDougall\\'s partition suit must fail.',\n",

The Supreme Courts of Louisiana, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Alaska have all construed the 1990 Amendment to prohibit reopening pre-McCarty divorce decrees. See Schexnayder v. Holbert, 714 So. 2d 680, 684 (La. 1998) (community property state); Terry v. Lee, 314 S.C. 420, 445 S.E.2d 435, 438 (1994); Hollyfield v. Hollyfield, 618 So. 2d 1303, 1305 (Miss.1993); Johnson v. Johnson, 824 P.2d 1381, 1383-84 (Alaska 1992). Moreover, New Mexico and California courts have also determined that the 1990 Amendment bars a state court\\'s ability to partition unmentioned military retirement benefits, regardless of state community property laws. See Hennessy v. Duryea, 124 N.M. 754, 955 P.2d 683, 688 (App. 1998); In re Marriage of Curtis, 7 Cal. App. 4th 1, 9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 145, 154 (1992). In Buys, we recognized that other states\\' courts had not considered the Act\\'s effect on divorce decrees that contained a residuary clause. See Buys, 924 S.W.2d at 374-75. Rather, the decree at issue in those cases, like the one we consider today, did not expressly allocate the military benefits \"in any way.\" See Buys, 924 S.W.2d at 374; see also Johnson, 824 P.2d at 1381-82.',\n",

See Hennessy, 955 P.2d at 688; Buys, 924 S.W.2d at 370. We agree with the California and New Mexico courts that the 1990 Amendment limits a trial court's authority to consider any property rights in military retirement benefits not asserted in the original divorce decree.

Their contingent fee contract assigned forty percent of any recovery to MHR, and forty-five percent if the case \"is appealed to a higher court.\"[1] After the jury returned a verdict against Westinghouse in excess of twenty-five million dollars, the parties began settlement negotiations. While the negotiations were ongoing, the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict, and the deadline for perfecting an appeal was October 29, 1991.',\n",
       "  \"By mid-October, Westinghouse had tentatively agreed to a settlement.[2] To preserve its right to appeal should the settlement fall through, Westinghouse, on October 18, 1991, filed a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond with the trial court. MHR and the Lopezes met on October 21 to discuss the settlement and MHR's fees. The Lopezes' estate and tax attorneys, their family attorney and an accountant attended this meeting. MHR explained to the Lopezes that its fee would be forty-five percent of the recovery, or $6,750,000, and no one voiced an *860 objection. The settlement was ultimately signed on October 30, 1991. Among other documents, the Lopez family members signed a settlement statement reflecting MHR's forty-five percent fee percentage. The funds were distributed according to the settlement statement, and Westinghouse took no further action on its appeal.\",\n",
       "  'About three years later, MHR received a letter requesting that the firm refund the additional five percent fee to the Lopez family. When MHR refused, the Lopezes sued, alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, and DTPA violations. The Lopezes sought forfeiture of the entire fee. The Lopezes moved for summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty and contract claims and moved to sever the other claims. MHR filed a cross-motion for summary judgment alleging that the doctrines of accord and satisfaction and \"acceptance of benefits\" defeated the Lopezes\\' claims and that limitations barred their breach of fiduciary duty claim. MHR also claimed that the summary judgment evidence showed no contract breach as a matter of law.',\n",
       "  'The trial court denied the Lopezes\\' summary judgment and severance motions, and granted MHR\\'s motion for summary judgment except as to limitations. The court of appeals reversed. See 980 S.W.2d 738, 744. The appeals court held that MHR breached the fee agreement by charging the forty-five percent appeal rate, and that the contract breach was also a breach of fiduciary duty. See id. at 742-43. The court reasoned that \"appealed to a higher court\" means something more than initiating the appellate process by filing a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond. See id at 742. The appeals court further held that MHR\\'s affirmative defenses did not defeat the Lopezes\\' recovery, and reversed and rendered a $750,000 judgment for the Lopezes, representing five percent of the settlement. See id. at 742. The court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of the Lopezes\\' claim for attorneys\\' fees. One justice, concurring and dissenting, agreed with the majority that MHR had breached its fiduciary duty but concluded that the appropriate remedy was forfeiture of MHR\\'s entire fee. See id. at 744-45 (Duncan, J., concurring and dissenting).',\n",

See Gonzalez v. Mission American Ins. Co., 795 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex.1990). They also argue that, because of the fiduciary nature of the relationship, any contract between an attorney and a client must be construed in a reasonable and equitable manner. Cf. Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 20 S.W.3d 692 (Tex.2000); Archer v. Griffith, 390 S.W.2d 735, 739 (Tex.1964). The Lopezes contend that the contract provision at issue is subject to only one reasonable and ethical meaning, although their expression of that meaning is less than clear. While these general rules of construction apply when we construe ambiguous contracts or contracts that are reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, we hold that the contract language at issue is unambiguous and that MHR did not breach the contract. See Heritage Resources, Inc. v. NationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex.1996) (stating that an unambiguous contract will be enforced as written).',\n",

In construing contracts, we must ascertain and give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the document. See id. A contract is not ambiguous if it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation. See Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v.

Ambiguity does not arise simply because the parties advance conflicting interpretations of the contract; rather, for an ambiguity to exist, both interpretations must be reasonable. See Columbia Gas, 940 S.W.2d at 589; National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995).

The problem with this approach, however, is that it expands the actual contract language and makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine with any certainty when a case has been \"appealed.\"',\n",

That an appeal may encompass multiple and various stages does not mean that the contract language is ambiguous. Under our former appellate rules, an appeal was \"taken\" and the court of appeals\\' jurisdiction invoked when a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond was filed.

As the court of appeals noted, \"the Lopez family tied its breach of fiduciary duty claim to its breach of contract claim.\" 980 S.W.2d at 740. In their summary judgment motion, the Lopezes summarized the facts and argued that MHR\\'s behavior breached the contract. Their argument that MHR breached its fiduciary duty followed immediately: \"Further, such conduct constitutes, as a matter of law, a breach of the Defendant\\'s fiduciary obligation to the Plaintiffs.\" Nowhere in their pleadings, their motion for summary judgment, or their response to MHR\\'s motion for summary judgment did the Lopezes argue that MHR breached its fiduciary duty other than by breaching its contract. Although counsel later posited that MHR had a duty to inform the Lopezes that there was an alternate colorable construction of the triggering clause, the Lopezes neither pleaded nor briefed this theory.',\n",
       "  'Texans for Reasonable Legal Fees (TRLF) has filed an amicus brief arguing that MHR\\'s fee is unreasonable despite the fee agreement and that MHR breached its fiduciary duty by charging an excessive fee. Alternatively, TRLF contends MHR breached its fiduciary duty by failing to inform the Lopezes that the phrase \"if the case is appealed to a higher court\" might colorably be interpreted to mean something other than \"if appeal is perfected.\" Whether or not these theories have merit, they are not before us.',\n",

We have already decided that the trial court did not err in granting MHR's motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.

The motion to sever was combined with their motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims. In response, MHR filed a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that (1) the parties had reached an accord and satisfaction, (2) the Lopezes accepted the benefits of the settlement and were therefore estopped from contesting it, (3) the breach of fiduciary duty claim was barred by limitations, and (4) there was no breach of contract as a matter of law. The trial court denied the Lopezes' severance and summary judgment motions, and rendered summary judgment for MHR on all of the Lopezes' claims without specifying the grounds for its ruling. We have upheld the trial court's summary judgment in MHR's favor on the Lopezes' breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims.

See Jenkins v. Henry C. Beck Co., 449 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex.1969). MHR claims that the Lopez family\\'s agreement to accept the settlement after full disclosure of the forty-five percent additional fee constituted an accord, which was satisfied when the Lopezes accepted payment of their part of the settlement funds. However, for this defense to prevail, there must be a dispute and an unmistakable communication to the creditor that tender of the reduced sum is upon the condition that acceptance will satisfy the underlying obligation. See id. The parties must specifically and intentionally agree to the discharge of one of the parties\\' existing obligations. See Industrial Life Ins. Co. v. Finley, 382 S.W.2d 100, 104 (Tex.1964). In other words, to prevail on its defense, MHR was required to present summary judgment evidence that the Lopezes disputed the fee and specifically and intentionally agreed to relinquish any claims they might have had against MHR for its alleged overcharge. To knowingly relinquish claims arising out of MHR\\'s alleged overcharge the Lopezes would have to know that an overcharge existed. There is no evidence in the record, however, that there was a fee dispute between the Lopezes and MHR when the Lopezes accepted the settlement. \"A valid accord and satisfaction requires that there initially be a legitimate dispute between the parties about what was expected.\" Bueckner v. Hamel, 886 S.W.2d 368, 372 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied). Accordingly, MHR was not entitled to summary judgment on its accord and satisfaction defense.',\n",
       "  \"*864 MHR's remaining defense, acceptance of the benefits, is a species of quasi-estoppel. See Atkinson Gas Co. v.

Quasi-estoppel precludes a party from asserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken. See id.

We give contract terms their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning unless the instrument shows that the parties used them in a technical or different sense. See Heritage Resources, Inc. v. NationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex.1996). Neither the parties nor the Court contends that \"appealed to a higher court\" is a technical term or a term of art. The Court, however, ignores the tenets of contract construction by adopting a technical and specialized meaning of the term \"appealed to a higher court.\" While the public would generally understand that some act must *865 be taken to initiate the appellate process, it defies common sense to conclude that the general public would understand the term to mean the point in time a party files a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond. The Court\\'s own words confirm the ambiguity about this term. The Court concludes that the filing of a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond results in an appeal, and yet states that filing a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond preserves a right to appeal\\x97suggesting that an appeal has yet to occur. 22 S.W.3d 857, 861. Generally, only members of the legal profession have any reason to know and appreciate that filing a cash deposit in lieu of a cost bond preserved a right to appeal under the old rules. Such a limited and specialized meaning cannot be the plain and common meaning of the term for purposes of this contract.',\n",

But the Court has no obligation to reach an interpretation that achieves certainty if a construction is inconsistent with the intent of the parties as reflected in the words of the contract. Instead, the Court must construe the contract as written, not as it would have drafted the contract had it been a party. See Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983).',\n",
       "  'Even if providing certainty were the goal in construing this contract, the Court does not explain why perfection of an appeal is any more certain than other stages of the appellate process. The Court concedes that the appellate process involves many steps, and I find nothing in the contract that specifies that the law firm is entitled to the additional fee for services rendered if the right to appeal is preserved\\x97which is all that really happened here. The contract merely provides for the additional fee if the case is \"appealed.\" Thus, it is the Court that expands the contract language by choosing the preparatory stage of the appellate process. And as for the certainty in contract desired by the Court, that can surely be achieved by choosing other equally determinable events in the appellate process.',\n",

First, this term reasonably could mean the first procedural or technical step taken to preserve the right to appeal\\x97the interpretation adopted by the Court. Second, the term \"appealed to a higher court\" could mean when a party expresses his or her complaint to an appellate court and seeks redress. Under this view, the term \"appealed\" would correspond with the filing of the appellant\\'s brief in the court of appeals or the filing of a petition for review in this Court. Third, one could conclude that the term \"appealed\" contemplates a completed act. In that case, \"appealed\" could mean when the parties have fully expressed their arguments and have submitted the case to an appellate court for a decision. Each of these constructions is consistent with the plain language of the contract, and each would provide the certainty important to the Court. Because I conclude there are multiple reasonable meanings of the term \"appealed to a higher court,\" I would hold that this contract is ambiguous. See Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983) (explaining a contract is ambiguous when its meaning is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning).',\n",
       "  'Generally, when the objective meaning of a contract term is ambiguous, the parties\\' subjective meaning of the term becomes a fact question. See Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. New Ulm Gas, *866 Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587, 589 (Tex.1996). In some circumstances, however, courts will construe the contract to favor one party in light of the relationship of the parties or public policy. See Temple-Eastex, Inc. v. Addison Bank, 672 S.W.2d 793, 798 (Tex. 1984) (\"a writing is generally construed most strictly against its author and in such a manner as to reach a reasonable result consistent with the apparent intent of the parties.\") For example, when an insurance contract is ambiguous, the contract is construed against the insurer. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Vaughan, 968 S.W.2d 931, 933 (Tex.1998). One court construed an equipment lease against the drafter because that party was responsible for choosing the ambiguous language and could have used clearer terms. See General Corrosion Services Corp. v. K Way Equip. Co., Inc., 631 S.W.2d 578, 580 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1982, no writ). However, this Court has not applied the rule of construction to an employment contract between an attorney and client.[1]',\n",
       "  'The special relationship between a lawyer and client leads me to conclude that an ambiguous contract between them should generally be construed against the lawyer-drafter. The Restatement of Contracts suggests that construing contracts against the drafter is justified when the drafter is in a better position to know of uncertainties of meaning or when the drafting party has the stronger bargaining position. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206 com. a (1981). The Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, which adopts a similar construction rule for lawyer-client contracts, adds the rationale that lawyers are more able than most clients to detect and repair omissions in lawyer-client agreements. See Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers § 29A com. h (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 1996). These reasons suggest that ambiguities in fee contracts should be construed against the lawyer-drafter. Usually a lawyer is in a better position to understand the terms of a contract drafted by the lawyer than a client. Clients, after all, are clients because they need legal advice and seek to hire lawyers with greater legal skill and experience. Additionally, a lawyer is usually in a stronger bargaining position and generally has more experience negotiating contracts, settlements, and fee arrangements. Finally, lawyers, because of their training and experience, are in a better position than most of their clients to discover and correct ambiguities in the contract.',\n",
       "  'For these reasons, I would generally construe ambiguous lawyer-client contracts against the lawyer-drafter. But even if the Court is unwilling to adopt such a rule of construction, it should at least remand because the objective meaning of the contract term \"appealed to a higher court\" is ambiguous.',\n",
       "  'The Lopez family also alleges that the Muñoz law firm breached its fiduciary duty by breaching their contract. In Texas, we hold attorneys to the highest standards of ethical conduct in their dealings with their clients. See Archer v. Griffith, 390 S.W.2d 735, 739 (Tex.1964). The duty is highest when the attorney contracts with his or her client or otherwise takes a position adverse to his or her client\\'s interests. As Justice Cardozo observed, \"[a fiduciary] is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior.\" Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, *867 164 N.E. 545, 546 (1928). Accordingly, a lawyer must conduct his or her business with inveterate honesty and loyalty, always keeping the client\\'s best interest in mind.',\n",
       "  'Clearly, a breach of fiduciary duty may arise if a lawyer accepts fees that the lawyer is not entitled to by contract. But not every breach of contract is necessarily a breach of fiduciary duty. If a lawyer acts in good faith under a colorable interpretation of a contract, the lawyer does not necessarily act against a client\\'s interest. See Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers § 28 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 1996) (limiting professional discipline to intentional failures to fulfill a valid contract). Here, the Muñoz law firm accepted the additional fee under one of several reasonable interpretations of the contract, and the Lopez family does not allege that the firm was acting in bad faith. Accordingly, even if the fact finder were to conclude that the term \"appealed to a higher court\" refers to a point in time after the right to appeal is preserved, I would hold that the Muñoz firm did not breach its fiduciary duty to the Lopez family by breaching its contract.',\n",
       "  'But there are two other ethical issues in this case, about which the Lopez family does not complain, that nonetheless deserve discussion. The first relates to a lawyers\\'s duty to fully and honestly inform his or her client of a fee arrangement. See TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.03(b), 1.04(d) (1989), reprinted in TEX. GOV\\'T CODE ANN., tit. 2, subtit. G App. A (1998). The fiduciary relationship between attorney and client requires \"absolute and perfect candor, openness and honesty, and the absence of any concealment or deception.\" Perez v. Kirk & Carrigan, 822 S.W.2d 261, 265 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1991, writ denied); see also Willis v. Maverick, 760 S.W.2d 642, 645 (Tex. 1988). Fundamentally, a lawyer should always act in the client\\'s best interests. A lawyer and client\\'s negotiations are often imbalanced in favor of the lawyer because of information inequalities and the client\\'s customary reliance on the lawyer\\'s legal advice. Consequently, a lawyer should fully explain to the client the meaning and impact of any contract between them. Here, for example, to best serve their client, and to protect their own interests, the Muñoz firm could have explained to the Lopez family at the time the contract was signed that the firm believed it would be entitled to an additional fee the moment Westinghouse preserved their right to appeal, even though an agreement in principle had been reached to settle the case.',\n",
       "  \"Another ethical consideration that deserves mention is the lawyer's fiduciary duty not to collect an unconscionable fee from his client. See TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.04(a); Nolan v. Foreman, 665 F.2d 738, 741 (5th Cir.1982) (holding under Texas law an attorney breaches a fiduciary duty to the client by charging an excessive fee). A fee is unconscionable if a competent lawyer could not form a reasonable belief that the fee is reasonable. See TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.04(a). The reasonableness of any fee depends on the circumstances of the services. See TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.04(b) (detailing factors to weigh in determining reasonableness of fees); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, §§ 46, 47 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 1996). Generally, however, a lawyer's fee is unreasonable if it is grossly disproportionate to the work and the risks. See TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.04(b); Committee on Legal Ethics v. Tatterson, 177 W.Va. 356, 352 S.E.2d 107, 113 (1986); The Florida Bar v. Moriber, 314 So. 2d 145, 149 (Fla.1975); see also General Motors Corp. v. Bloyed, 916 S.W.2d 949, 960 (Tex.1996) (discussing lodestar method to calculate lawyer's fees in class actions as calculated by multiplying the number of hours expended by an appropriate hourly rate determined by a variety of factors, such as the benefits obtained for the class, the complexity of the issues involved, the expertise of counsel, the preclusion of other legal work due to acceptance of the *868 class action suit, and the hourly rate customarily charged in the region for similar legal work).\",\n",
       "  'The fee contract here compensated the lawyers for \"services rendered.\" There is evidence in the record that the firm did some work in connection with an appeal both before and after the cash deposit in lieu of cost bond was filed. But the record also suggests that the Lopez family and Westinghouse had agreed in principle to a settlement, substantially lowering the risk to the law firm\\x97a risk existing in all contingent fee contracts\\x97that it might not collect its fees. While a contract may entitle a lawyer to a substantial fee for little or no work, a lawyer may nonetheless be required by his or her fiduciary duty to decline the fee. Additionally, a law firm may breach its fiduciary duty if it provides little or no services, but still collects a substantial part of its clients recovery in the face of a pending settlement.',\n",
       "  'By all appearances, the law firm did a good job representing its client against Westinghouse. The firm obtained a twenty-five million dollar jury award and participated in negotiating a fifteen million dollar settlement. The lawyers should be fully compensated for their work and the risks they assumed. I do not begrudge them for demanding compensation for services rendered according to their contract.[2] But the demand must be clearly supported by the contract. And when construing contracts between lawyers and clients, it is not enough to simply say that a contract is a contract. There are ethical considerations overlaying the contractual relationship. Lawyers should be just as mindful of these ethical obligations as their contractual obligations.',\n",

During the policy term, Donald McNeilly suffered brain damage and later died as a result of a collision involving McNeilly and a vehicle owned or operated by R & D. James Embrey, Donald McNeilly\\'s guardian, the Estate of Donald McNeilly, and Nancy McNeilley (Eller), sued R & D, and Royal Indemnity provided a defense.',\n",

Embrey admitted that the policy does not contain any language specifically pertaining to prejudgment interest, but argued that the policy's Supplemental Payments provision, read in conjunction with a State Board of Insurance Order, obligates Royal Indemnity to pay prejudgment interest.

The next year, Bell sued the City and the School District in federal court, claiming that the tax was unlawful.

The City does not dispute that a governmental entity may waive immunity by entering into a contract,[13] but it argues that it made no such contract in 1936. Even if it did, the City argues that any obligation it owed the School District lacked consideration, and that the agreement was unlawful for several reasons.

Ordinance No.1935, the City argues, was a unilateral action on its part in which no waiver of immunity can be found or implied. The City's argument ignores well-established law that instruments pertaining to the same transaction may be read together to ascertain the parties' intent,[14] even if the parties executed the instruments at different times and the instruments do not expressly refer to each other,[15] and that a court may determine, as a matter of law, that multiple documents comprise a written contract.[16] In appropriate instances, courts may construe all the documents as if they were part of a single, unified instrument.[17]\",\n",

The School District\\'s resolution accepting Ordinance No.1935 stated that the \"said controversy has been compromised and settled, as evidenced by [Ordinance No.1933].\" Bell accepted \"the terms of the resolution\", describing it as approving the settlement and compromise of the federal suit between the parties.

While a change in the law in 1945 apparently excused the City from serving any longer as tax assessor-collector for the School District, the consideration the parties had already received was sufficient to support their agreement, which could have been terminated by either party at will. We easily conclude that the City has not proved that its obligation to the School District under Ordinance No.1935 was unenforceable for lack of consideration.\",\n",

Finally, the City argues that Ordinance No.1933 was an \"irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges\" to Bell in violation of article I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution,[21] and a \"[p]erpetuit[y] ... contrary to the genius of a free government\" in violation of article I, section 26 of the Texas Constitution.[22]',\n",
       "  'All of these arguments are answered by another argument the City makes: that the agreement reflected in Ordinances Nos.1933 and 1935 was terminable at the will of any party, and that the arrangement was in fact terminated by the adoption of Ordinance No. 11163. We agree with this latter argument, which answers the others the City makes. We have previously stated that \"contracts which contemplate continuing performance (or successive performances) and which are indefinite in duration can be terminated at the will of either party.\"[23] Nothing in the 1936 arrangement obligated any of the parties to continue with it for any length of time. Therefore, the City has not proved that it was committed to a lasting arrangement in violation of any prohibition against such things.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  '2',\n",
       "  'The City\\'s most serious attack on the validity of the 1936 arrangement is that Ordinance No.1935 required it to *842 grant its funds to the School District in violation of article III, section 51 of the Texas Constitution, which states that \"[t]he Legislature shall have no power to make any grant or authorize the making of any grant of public moneys to any individual, association of individuals, municipal or other corporations whatsoever\", and section 52 of the same article, which similarly provides that with exceptions not here applicable, \"the Legislature shall have no power to authorize any county, city, town or other political corporation or subdivision of the State to lend its credit or to grant public money or thing of value in aid of, or to an individual, association or corporation whatsoever\". To answer this argument, we must determine whether Bell\\'s payments under Ordinance No.1933 were solely for City services and taxes or whether they were also for School District taxes. If the former, then the City could not apportion them to the School District because they would constitute the City\\'s \"public money\".',\n",
       "  'This Court\\'s objective in construing written language is to give effect to the intent expressed in that language by the person or persons who wrote it or who agreed to be bound by it. Ordinance No.1933 required Bell to pay the City \"an annual inspection fee and service charge\" as:',\n",
       "  \"compensation to the City for the expense incurred and services rendered by the City in exercising its police power of regulation and supervision over the construction and location of [Bell's] poles, wires, conduits, equipment and other facilities in the streets, alleys, highways and public grounds of the City....\",\n",
       "  'This language strongly suggests that Bell\\'s payments were solely for services rendered by the City and not for any taxes owed the City or the School District. But the ordinance adds that Bell\\'s payment is \"in lieu of [all] taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals, and easement or franchise taxes\". The phrase, \"in lieu of\", often means \"instead of\",[24] but it can also mean \"as a payment ... for\".[25] One noted lexicographer has warned that for \"in lieu of\", \"instead of will not always suffice in its stead\".[26] Using dictionary definitions, Ordinance No.1933 could be read to mean either that Bell was to pay only a fee for City services and nothing for taxes, as the City argues, or that its payment was to be for City services as well as all taxes or other obligations due, as the School District argues. Although Bell is generally aligned with the City in this case, it sides with the School District on this issue, taking the position, understandably, that its payments under Ordinance No.1933 fully discharged its entire obligation to the City and School District.',\n",
       "  'To determine the parties\\' intent, we must look at the arrangement as a whole.[27] When we do, we find several reasons to agree with Bell and the School District. First, the percentage of gross revenues that Bell was to pay annually was proposed by its lawyer as \"a basis for ... computation\" of ad valorem taxes on Bell\\'s easement that would \"avoid future controversies\", not solely as a means of determining what the City\\'s proper charges were for exercising its supervisory police power. Second, to charge Bell only a fee for services and not assess ad valorem taxes would clearly violate (as we explain in more detail below) article VIII, section 1(a) of the Texas Constitution, which requires that taxation be \"equal and uniform\". In short, the City could not simply forgive Bell its City taxes, let alone its School District taxes, in exchange for a payment for City services. Third, if the *843 City intended Bell\\'s payments under Ordinance No.1933 to be solely for City services, there would have been no reason whatsoever for the City to then agree to apportion the payments to the School District, as it did in Ordinance No.1935. The School District had no police power and hence no right to payment for its exercise; payments to the School District could only have been for taxes. Fourth, the School District had no reason to settle its valid claim for ad valorem taxes, that had only months earlier been vindicated by the Fifth Circuit after eight years of litigation, by agreeing to an arrangement whereby Bell would pay nothing for taxes. The controversy was all about taxes, and so were the motives for settling. Fifth, Bell likewise had no reason to settle its liability for ad valorem taxes to the City and the School District by agreeing to an arrangement that satisfied only its obligation for City services. Unless its tax liability was thereby discharged, Bell accomplished nothing by way of settlement. Sixth, several court opinions published in the same era as the 1936 agreement in this case recognize the difficulty in valuing easements and franchises and note that gross income or profit is a typical method for calculating taxes on such property interests.[28] These opinions give some indication that the parties\\' arrangement in this case was one commonly used to determine tax liability. Finally, Bell has continued to make the same arrangement with other municipalities.[29]',\n",
       "  \"We think it makes little sense to say that Ordinance No.1933 settled a tax dispute without discharging the disputed tax liability. We conclude that the City has not established that Bell's payments under Ordinance No.1933 were not in part for the School District's taxes. Since any payment for such taxes was not public money that belonged to the City but was merely collected for the School District, the City has not established that its apportionments to the School District violated article III, Sections 51 and 52 of the Texas Constitution.\",\n",

       "  \"Bell argues that the 1936 arrangement was an unlawful assessment of taxes. Bell's arguments, if correct, would defeat the School District's claims against both Bell and the City.\",\n",
       "  'Bell contends that Ordinance No.1933 assessed taxes in violation of article VIII, section 1(a) of the Texas Constitution, which requires that \"[t]axation shall be equal and uniform\", and article VIII, section 1(b) of the Texas Constitution, which requires that property \"be taxed in proportion to its value\". Taxation satisfies these provisions only when a lawfully adopted, generally applicable tax rate is *844 applied to the property\\'s market value,[30] and the appraisal and assessment follow the procedures provided by law, i.e., the Texas Property Tax Code.[31] Bell also contends that Ordinance No.1933 did not, after 1982, comply with article VIII, section 18(b) of the Texas Constitution, which requires \"[a] single appraisal within each county of all property subject to ad valorem taxation\". The statutes enabling this provision have given the county appraisal district exclusive authority to appraise all property subject to ad valorem taxes in the county.[32] Bell claims that Ordinance No.1933\\'s special tax arrangement, whereby Bell paid a percentage of its gross receipts in lieu of all charges, fees, and taxes on its franchise and easement, without regard to market value, is contrary to these constitutional and statutory requirements. No other taxpayer in the district had a similar arrangement.',\n",
       "  'The inconsistency between these arguments and Bell\\'s conduct for more than fifty years is obvious. Its lawyer proposed the 1936 settlement and stressed that \"our final agreement to the outlined arrangement would depend on our ability with the legal department of the city, to work out agreements legal and valid in all particulars\". One might suppose that the arrangement it ultimately agreed to was therefore \"legal and valid in all particulars\". But Bell\\'s position here is that although it made payments under Ordinance No.1933 from 1937 to 1992, and agreed in 1992 to make similar payments under Ordinance No. 11163 for five years, it has always considered all such payments to be illegal. Bell has not explained why it voluntarily participated in conduct it considered to be illegal.',\n",
       "  'It is a fundamental rule of constitutional law that a court \"will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.\"[33] A party contractually waives its constitutional or statutory rights by intelligently, voluntarily, and knowingly relinquishing a known right or acting inconsistent with claiming that right.[34] Bell proposed and for more than half a century complied with the 1936 settlement agreement, which it could have terminated at any time, electing instead to take the benefits from the arrangement. Bell has thus waived its complaints that the 1936 arrangement was unlawful.',\n",
       "  \"In addition, Bell has failed to establish that the 1936 arrangement was unlawful. The City and the School District were authorized to settle their tax dispute with Bell, which involved difficult valuation issues that were likely to be disputed for years, by agreeing to an amount that they were satisfied would approximate the tax *845 liability.[35] Neither a taxing authority nor a taxpayer can circumvent the constitutional restrictions on, or requirements for, taxation merely by agreeing to settle a dispute. But by the same token, a fair settlement of a legitimate dispute that contemplates the market value of the property is not unconstitutional simply because it is not an appraisal and assessment done by standard procedure.[36] It was Bell's burden, as the movant for summary judgment, to establish the illegality of the arrangement, and it has failed to do so.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'IV',\n",
       "  'Three issues remain.',\n",
       "  \"First: the City contends that the School District has received all payments it is due. Neither party denies that beginning in 1966, Bell began making additional payments to the City that it did not share with the School District. But the City argues that Bell separately agreed to reimburse the City with these additional funds for the gross receipts payments it apportioned to the School District under Ordinance No.1933 so that it would receive the same amount of gross receipts payments that Bell paid other municipalities across the state. Because the City did not realize these additional funds as gross receipts payments under Ordinance No.1933, and Ordinance No.1935 limited the School District's right to apportionment to only those funds received under Ordinance No.1933, the City claims the School District is not entitled to any portion of the reimbursement payments.\",\n",
       "  'The School District believes, for several reasons, that these additional payments from Bell can only be gross receipts payments that should have been apportioned pursuant to Ordinance No.1933. To begin with, the School District reasons that Ordinance Nos.1933 and 1935 are the City\\'s sole sources of authority provided by the City Charter to accept any additional payments from Bell. Moreover, since 1978 Bell has passed through these additional payment costs to its customers under Ordinance No.1933, which is the only authority Bell has for passing through such payments to its customers under the terms of its General Exchange Tariff with the Texas Public Utilities Commission. And Bell has explained this to customers that have inquired about the additional charge. Additionally, the School District maintains that Bell never intended for the City to not apportion the payments, and that any description of the additional payments as \"separate and apart\" from the other apportioned payments was merely to clarify that Bell could cease making them at any time. Relying upon the text of Ordinance No.1935, the School District contends that the phrase \"all of the funds realized from the gross receipts taxes under Ordinance No.1933\" reflects the parties\\' intent to apportion all payments actually made by Bell that the City received. Alternatively, the School District asserts that this language in Ordinance No.1935 is ambiguous\\x97it *846 could either refer to all payments Bell made to the City or could be limited to only those funds earmarked under the original agreement\\x97and thus summary judgment is improper because the interpretation of the instrument is a fact question for the jury.',\n",
       "  'The record clearly reflects factual disputes over this issue that preclude summary judgment. Reasonable minds could differ as to whether the City fulfilled its obligations under Ordinance No.1935. Accordingly, we remand this issue to the trial court.',\n",
       "  \"Second: the City contends that the School District's claim that the City failed to monitor Bell's payments and discover deficits is barred by immunity. We agree and affirm the summary judgment in part as to this issue.\",\n",
       "  \"Tax collecting by a city is undeniably a governmental function.[37] As such, any liability for wrongs committed by city officials in performing that function cannot be enforced against the city.[38] Thus, even if the City was negligent in monitoring Bell's payments, the School District is barred from any recovery as the City is immune from liability. We affirm the City's summary judgment in part on the School District's `failure-to-monitor' claim.\",\n",
       "  \"Third: the School District contends that the City Manager's 1992 letter is an enforceable agreement requiring the City to apportion with the School District funds collected from Bell under Ordinance No. 11163. The City argues that the letter represents an unenforceable agreement to agree and that the city manager lacked the authority to bind the City in such an agreement.\",\n",
       "  'The City Manager\\'s letter provides in pertinent part: \"If the City should negotiate a new agreement with [Bell], we commit the City to arriving at an appropriate arrangement with the FWISD to share in that revenue.\" The School District\\'s representative signed the letter in acceptance of the City\\'s offer. Based on the letter\\'s language, we find it to be an agreement to make a future contract.',\n",

The School District suggests that implied in this agreement was that the City would apportion the payment with it on the same basis as the City had for the previous fifty years\\x97in accordance with their respective ad valorem tax rates. But a number of factors convince us of the contrary.',\n",
       "  \"First, because the City and Bell had not negotiated a contract at the time the City and the School District agreed to this future contract, neither party knew the basis for the calculation, much less the amount the City would ultimately receive from Bell. Moreover, the record reveals that the City suffered from financial straits at the time\\x97which the School District was aware of\\x97and it wanted to retain as much of the payment as it could. The City's financial woes were, after all, part of the impetus for negotiating a new arrangement with Bell. Certainly it is not unreasonable to suggest that had the City agreed to apportion payments received under Ordinance No. 11163 with the School District, the City would have tried to decrease the School District's share compared to the prior agreement. Furthermore, both the City and the School District had concerns about the effect that County Education Districts, which operated as a separate ad valorem taxing authority in each county beginning in 1991, had on the School District's tax rate used for apportioning Bell's gross receipt payment under Ordinance No.1935. In fact the letter agreement referenced this concern and prospective changes, and proposed an interim agreement. Considering all of the uncertainty surrounding the extant apportionment scheme, the City's financial strife, and the City's negotiations with Bell, we find it virtually impossible that the parties reached a meeting of the minds as to the amount or percentage the School District would receive.\",\n",

We affirm in part the summary judgment for the City as to the School District's claim to payment under the 1992 letter agreement. Because this does not dispose of the School District's claims related to Bell's payments to the City under Ordinance No.1933 and the City's payment to the School District under Ordinance No.1935, we do not affirm the summary judgment in its entirety.\",\n",

The franchisees assert causes of action for fraudulent inducement, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent misrepresentations, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act[2] and the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act.[3] The district court denied the defendants\\' motions to dismiss based on the forum-selection clause.',\n",

Zapata Off-Shore Co.,[4] the United States Supreme Court held that forum-selection clauses are enforceable in admiralty cases unless enforcement would be unreasonable under the circumstances or a clause was invalid for reasons such as duress or fraud. The Supreme Court observed that this is the general rule in all kinds of cases in most common-law countries, that it is the rule adopted by the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws,[5] and that it \"accords with ancient concepts of freedom of contract\".[6] Although this Court has not had occasion to consider the matter, the uniform view of Texas courts of appeals is that forum-selection clauses are generally enforceable,[7] provided they are reasonable and valid,[8] and that a forum state agreed upon would enforce the selection of Texas as the forum in similar circumstances.[9]',\n",

Alberto-Culver Co., the United States Supreme Court clarified the fraud exception to enforceability mentioned in Bremen to require that the forum-selection clause itself must be fraudulently induced, and not merely the agreement of which it was one provision.[10] Although one Texas court has reached a contrary conclusion,[11] any other rule would permit the party to a contract to escape a forum-selection provision merely by asserting a misrepresentation relating to some aspect of the agreement. Scherk is clearly the only practical rule.',\n",
       "  \"The franchisees also argue that their forum-selection clause does not apply to the tort and statutory claims they have asserted. Some Texas courts have stated that forum-selection clauses should not apply to tort and statutory claims,[12] but others have indicated that such claims are subject to a forum-selection clause if they arise out of the parties' contractual relationship.[13] The latter courts are correct; otherwise a party could escape a forum-selection-clause merely by adding some noncontractual claim to his pleadings.\",\n",
       "  '*931 The franchisees argue that Pennsylvania would not enforce an agreement designating Texas as the forum for litigating such claims, citing Churchill Corp. v. Third Century, Inc.[14] While the court there refused to force two small Pennsylvania companies to defend a Missouri lawsuit for $1,700 allegedly due on a lease of a photocopier, the court suggested that the result would have been different had the suit been on a franchise agreement.[15] It does not appear that the agreement in the present case would be unenforceable under Pennsylvania law.[16]',\n",

But there is no indication that it would not be at least as expensive and inconvenient for GNC to litigate in Texas. If they read their agreements when they signed them, as must be assumed, the franchisees knew that they were obligating themselves to litigate disputes with GNC in Pennsylvania. The fact that they no longer like the deal is no more reason to excuse them from the forum-selection clause than from any other provision of their agreements. The parties' relationship has significant contacts with Pennsylvania, and their agreement to litigate there was not unreasonable.\",\n",
       "  \"Finally, the franchisees argue that relators are not entitled to mandamus relief because they have an adequate remedy by appeal after the litigation in Texas is concluded. This is simply wrong. Relators contracted for the right to litigate disputes with the franchisees in Pennsylvania and not in Texas. If the district court erred in refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause, then even if relators prevail on appeal, they will have lost forever the right for which they contracted. To wait until appeal to rule that this litigation never should have been brought in Texas is not only to deny relators their rights, but to waste the parties' time and money, and to waste the lower courts' limited resources. An agreement to have disputes resolved in the courts of a certain state is no different from an agreement to have disputes resolved by arbitration; both are forum selection. We have held that the wrongful refusal to enforce an agreement to arbitrate cannot adequately be remedied by appeal.[17] The wrongful refusal to enforce a forum-selection clause is no different.[18]\",\n",

Id. at 759-60. In Bailey, we held that Rule 28 did not apply under the facts of that case because the corporate entity that the plaintiff sued had ceased to exist. The defunct corporation could not do business under an assumed or any other name because it had merged with another entity into a new corporation. We did say in dicta in Bailey that \"Rule 28 is a procedural rule of equity which allows Texas courts to toll a statute of limitations when the plaintiff\\'s efforts to name the correct party are hampered by the defendant\\'s `laying behind the log\\' of an assumed name.\" Id. at 759.

Hilland, 516 S.W.2d 279, 281 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14 th Dist.] 1974), and our own decision reversing that case, Continental Southern Lines, Inc. v. Hilland, 528 S.W.2d 828 (Tex.1975). Continental Southern involved misidentification rather than Rule 28. See 528 S.W.2d at 830-31. In misidentification cases, limitations may be tolled when a plaintiff sues an incorrect entity if there are two separate but related entities that use a similar trade name and the correct entity had notice of the suit and was not misled or disadvantaged by the mistake. See id. at 831. But Rule 28 is not a tolling provision when a party is sued in the name under which it conducts business and that party has actual notice of the suit. Rule 28 allows suit directly against the correct party in its assumed name. To the extent that Bailey and certain court of appeals decisions indicate that Rule 28 is a tolling provision, we disapprove of them. Bailey, 894 S.W.2d at 759; Bell v. State Farm Ins.

And the fact that the Association conducted business under an assumed name was also raised by Chilkewitz in his response to that motion. Chilkewitz's eighth amended petition, filed after the jury reached its verdict and after the Association moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, also asserted that the Association had conducted business under an assumed name.

At that time, Chilkewitz\\'s pleadings did not expressly assert Rule 28 or assumed name. But the Association did not object to evidence of assumed name and reconfirmed on the record that the trial court was to decide the limitations issue. After this testimony, and before the case was submitted to the jury, Chilkewitz filed his seventh amended petition, which once again expressly raised the assumed name issue. The trial court permitted the filing of that pleading, and the Association did not challenge that ruling on appeal.

To ascertain that intent, we look to the statutory language, the legislative history, the object of the legislation, and the consequences that would follow from alternate constructions.

       "  'TEX. PROB.CODE § 37A. The court of appeals noted that certain events, such as a change in the will or the expectancy holder predeceasing the testator, could alter or extinguish an expectancy interest. See 975 S.W.2d at 421-22. Reasoning that a person cannot be \"entitled\" to receive property until the testator\\'s death, the court concluded that a person named in a will cannot act in a beneficiary capacity until that time. Id. at 422.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, events occurring after the testator\\'s death may also alter or extinguish an expectant\\'s interest. A decedent\\'s property is burdened by the decedent\\'s debts and the estate\\'s administration expenses. See TEX. PROB.CODE § 322B. If there are insufficient assets to satisfy claims against the estate, bequests made by the testator will abate. See id. Therefore, even after the testator\\'s death, a person may not be \"entitled\" to receive property under a will. We do not believe that use of the word \"entitled\" indicates that the Legislature intended beneficiary status to be conditioned upon the testator\\'s death. If the Legislature had intended such a construction, it could have easily said so. We find the statute\\'s inclusive language to be more instructive. Section 37A states that \"`beneficiary\\' includes....,\" indicating that the definition of beneficiary for purposes of that section is not intended to be exclusive. See Republic Ins. Co. v. Silverton Elevators, Inc., 493 S.W.2d 748, 752 (Tex.1973) (stating that it is a \"well settled rule that the words `include,\\' `including,\\' and `shall include\\' are generally employed as terms of enlargement rather than limitation or restriction\"); Peerless Carbon Black Co. v. Sheppard et. al., 113 S.W.2d 996, 997-98 (Tex. Civ.App.-Austin 1938, writ ref\\'d). The *396 definition of beneficiary is broad enough to include expectants under a will.',\n",
       "  'We look next to section 37A\\'s legislative history and purposes. The Legislature enacted section 37A to clarify Texas\\'s disclaimer law. HOUSE COMM. on Judiciary, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B. 728, 62 nd Leg., R.S. (1971). Before section 37A was enacted, Texas did not have a disclaimer statute, and while there were cases allowing disclaimer, \"it was not clear as to when and how a [disclaimer] would be accomplished.\" William E. Remy, Effective Dates of Amendments to the Probate Code and a Brief Summary of the Changes Made, 34 TEX. B.J. 885, 886 (1971). The original version of section 37A, like its present version, prohibited disclaimer after property is accepted. See Act of June 15, 1971, 62 nd Leg., R.S., ch. 979, § 1, 1971 Tex. Gen. Laws 2954, 2956. While legislative history does not specify the provision\\'s purpose, the principal reason to prohibit disclaimer after acceptance is to protect third parties\\' interests in transactions with beneficiaries. Cf. Hale v. Hollon, 90 Tex. 427, 39 S.W. 287, 288 (1897) (recognizing that assignment of an expectancy is enforceable in equity). Because Texas law allows an expectancy to be conveyed or assigned, this purpose is equally animate whether the testator is alive or dead. Accordingly, affording beneficiary status to an expectant who pledges the property best serves the statute\\'s purpose. Conferring beneficiary status upon an expectant for disclaimer purposes avoids unjust consequences in other ways. See Sanchez v. Schindler, 651 S.W.2d 249, 252 (Tex.1983) (stating, \"[t]his court has always endeavored to interpret the laws of Texas to avoid inequity\"). If Elaine could not act in a beneficiary capacity until after her mother\\'s death, Gorham would be unable to collect for the services he rendered in reliance on her pledge. Although an expectancy may lapse due to events beyond the expectant\\'s control, equity should not allow the expectant to unilaterally renounce a benefit already obtained.',\n",
       "  'Finally, we must construe statutory provisions in context. See Jessen Assoc., Inc. v. Bullock, 531 S.W.2d 593, 601 (Tex.1975). In the context of section 37A(g), requiring beneficiary status for acceptance purposes protects the disclaimer rights of those who take possession or exercise control of property in some other capacity:',\n",
       "  \"Where a devisee or legatee is entitled to hold the devised or bequeathed property in a capacity other than that of a beneficiary under the will, such as that of an heir, executor, trustee, or partner, the fact that he entered into or retained possession of the property after the testator's death, or that he exercised certain control over it, does not necessarily give rise to an inference of acceptance of the devise or bequest, in the absence of some other act or conduct on his part tending to show an intent to claim the property as a beneficiary under the will.\",\n",
       "  \"C.P. Jhong, Annotation, What Constitutes or Establishes Beneficiary's Acceptance or Renunciation of Devise or Bequest, 93 A.L.R.2d 8, 41 (1964). Considering this context, there is no reason to condition beneficiary status on the testator's death.\",\n",
       "  \"Thus we conclude that a person who pledges an expectancy under a will acts in a beneficiary capacity for purposes of the disclaimer statute. This conclusion gives meaning to the language of the statute, advances section 37A(g)'s purpose, avoids unjust consequences, and makes sense in the statute's context. Accordingly, we hold that Elaine acted in the capacity of a beneficiary when she pledged her expectancy in her mother's home.\",\n",
       "  'We next consider whether Elaine\\'s pledge was an exercise of \"dominion and control\" over the property as the statute contemplates. TEX. PROB.CODE § 37A(g). The statute itself does not specify what actions qualify as an exercise of dominion and control. But under the Internal Revenue Code\\'s qualified disclaimer section, acts of acceptance include pledging property as security for a loan. See TREAS. REG. § 25.2518-2(d)(4). In 1979, the Legislature *397 amended section 37A, altering the requirements for making a disclaimer. See HOUSE COMM. ON JUDICIARY, BILL ANALYSIS, Tex. H.B. 329, 66th Leg., R.S. (1979). It did so to harmonize Texas\\'s disclaimer provisions with federal tax law. See id. We believe the Internal Revenue Code\\'s qualified disclaimer section is instructive on the issue of what actions qualify as an exercise of dominion and control. Accordingly, we conclude that pledging property to secure a loan is an exercise of dominion and control for purposes of the disclaimer statute. Elaine therefore exercised dominion and control over her expectancy when she pledged it to Gorham. Because she did so in the capacity of a beneficiary, she accepted the property under section 37A(g) and her disclaimer was ineffective.',\n",

Courts should find breach of a no-contest clause only when the acts of the parties come within the clause's express terms. See Gunter, 672 S.W.2d at 842. In applying for turnover relief from Elaine, Edward did not oppose the will or attempt to invalidate any of its provisions. He merely sought payment as a judgment creditor, and whether he would be able to collect depended upon Elaine's ability to inherit under the will.

       "  \"879 S.W.2d at 30. The court of appeals acknowledged the tension between the trial court's certification order and the rule in Moriel that a jury must decide liability and actual damages issues before it considers punitive damages. 960 S.W.2d at 298. The court of appeals' solution was to modify the certification order by adding another phase, prior to the punitive damages phase, to determine the class representatives' actual damages. Thus, the order of proof in the court of appeals' modified order is (1) duty, breach of duty, and gross negligence issues; (2) the nineteen class representatives' proximate cause and actual damages issues; (3) punitive damages for the entire class; and (4) the 885 remaining plaintiffs' proximate cause and actual damages issues.\",\n",
       "  'Southwestern contends that the multi-phase trial plan, as modified by the court of appeals, still conflicts with Moriel. Under the modified trial plan, evidence related to punitive damages, including net worth, will be introduced before the jury is asked to decide causation and actual damages for the 885 nonrepresentative members of the class. Also, the plan will require the jury to decide punitive damages before \"the totality of the evidence,\" including causation and the amount of actual damages for the 885 nonrepresentative class members, is presented. Plaintiffs argue that the modified trial plan does not conflict with Moriel because this case, unlike Moriel, is a class action, and that the different procedural context legitimately distinguishes the cases.',\n",

We observed that in Newman, three cases conflicted on a question of statutory construction, giving us jurisdiction, even though the legal question arose in each case in different factual circumstances. See Coastal, 979 S.W.2d at 320 (discussing Newman v. Obersteller). The cases discussed in Newman were different not only in the facts relating to the cause of action but also in their procedural facts: two were appealed from denial of summary judgments, and the third was appealed from a directed verdict after a trial on the merits. Compare Newman v. Obersteller, 915 S.W.2d 198 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1996), rev'd, 960 S.W.2d 621 and City of Galveston v.

As Coastal and Newman illustrate, our jurisdictional analysis must focus on whether differences in the facts, including procedural facts, prevent the holding in one case from controlling in another. Conversely, if the form of the proceeding is not important to whether the substantive legal principles we announced in Moriel would control the decision in this case, then we have jurisdiction to resolve the conflict.\",\n",
       "  'Here, the form of the lawsuit as a class action is not important to the substantive legal principles we announced in Moriel because of the breadth of our holding in that case. Our decision in Moriel is striking because it is stated as a categorical *432 imperative. We did not limit our holding to the particular facts of the case, nor did we state the principle as a general rule, thereby implying that there may be exceptions. Instead, we said that the Moriel standards \"apply to all punitive damage cases tried in the future.\" 879 S.W.2d at 26. We made no exception for class actions.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, our procedural rules do not permit the form of the proceeding to determine whether substantive legal principles will control. The dissent argues, in effect, that Moriel does not conflict because class actions are just different from ordinary litigation. But class actions do not exist in some sort of alternative universe outside our normal jurisprudence. Our procedural rules provide otherwise: the form of an action under the rules must not \"enlarge or diminish any substantive rights or obligations of any parties to any civil action.\" TEX.R. CIV. P. 815. Thus the form of this lawsuit, per se, is not a material factual difference that distinguishes the principles we announced in Moriel.',\n",
       "  \"In summary, we held in Moriel that in all punitive damages cases, a jury must return findings on liability and actual damages issues before it hears any evidence on punitive damages. In this punitive damages case, the court of appeals held that the plaintiffs may present evidence of punitive damages and obtain a finding before deciding most plaintiffs' actual damages. If Moriel is good law, the court of appeals' holding cannot be sustained. Conversely, we can uphold the court of appeals' holding only by overruling Moriel to the extent it applies to class actions. The ruling in one is necessarily conclusive in the other on a question of law material to the decision in the case.\",\n",

This case conflicts with Moriel, and we therefore have jurisdiction here. Because we conclude that the court of appeals\\' decision in this case conflicts with Moriel we need not conduct a conflicts analysis of RSR and Iley. Moreover, once a conflict confers jurisdiction on our Court, the case is before us for all purposes. See Randall\\'s Food Markets, Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 643-44 (Tex.1995); Stafford v.

       "  'The considerations that go into the decision to award punitive damages do not depend on whether the case was brought as a class action. In Moriel we were concerned that existing procedures *433 failed to ensure that punitive damage awards \"`are not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense and have some understandable relationship to compensatory damages.\\'\" Moriel, 879 S.W.2d at 29 (quoting Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 22, 111 S. Ct. 1032, 113 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991)). To achieve such proportionality, under Moriel, a jury must decide the amount of punitive damages based on the totality of the evidence from the liability phase as well as the punitive damages stage. Here, deciding the nineteen class representatives\\' actual damages first does not satisfy the concerns underpinning the legal principles announced in Moriel. Under the court of appeals\\' modified order, the jury would decide punitive damages for the entire class without knowing the severity of the offense or the extent of compensatory damages, if any, for each of the 885 plaintiffs. The certification order\\'s provision to eliminate punitive damages for plaintiffs who are not able to prove actual damages may limit the harm to Southwestern. But the modified trial plan is nevertheless prejudicial because it fails to ensure that punitive damages have some understandable relationship to compensatory damages and are not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense for each of the 885 plaintiffs. The concerns this Court articulated in Moriel apply equally in class action cases. Accordingly, we see no reason to except class actions from the rule articulated in Moriel.

The rule is patterned after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23; consequently, federal decisions and authorities interpreting current federal class action requirements are persuasive authority. See RSR Corp. v. Hayes, 673 S.W.2d 928, 931-32 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1984, writ dism\\'d). All class actions must satisfy four threshold requirements: (1) numerosity (\"the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\"); (2) commonality (\"there are questions of law or fact common to the class\"); (3) typicality (\"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class\"); and (4) adequacy of representation (\"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\"). See Tex.R. Civ. P. 42(a). In addition to these prerequisites, class actions must satisfy at least one of four subdivisions of Rule 42(b). Plaintiffs assert this class action satisfies Rule 42(b)(4), which requires common questions of law or fact to predominate over questions affecting only individual members and class treatment to be \"superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\" TEX.R.

       "  'The predominance requirement is intended to prevent class action litigation when the sheer complexity and diversity of the individual issues would overwhelm or confuse a jury or severely compromise a party\\'s ability to present viable claims or defenses. But the predominance requirement has not always been so rigorously applied. When presented with significant individual issues, some courts have simply remarked that creative means may be designed to deal with them, without identifying those means or considering whether they would vitiate the parties\\' ability to present viable claims or defenses. See, e.g., Amerada Hess Corp. v. Garza, 973 S.W.2d 667, 680 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1996), writ dism\\'d w.o.j., 979 S.W.2d 318 (Tex.1998); Franklin v. Donoho, 774 S.W.2d 308, 313 (Tex.App.-Austin 1989, no writ) (both expressing faith that, but not suggesting how, the trial court can creatively deal with significant individual issues in a manner that will be both fair and efficient). Other courts have indulged every presumption in favor of the trial court\\'s ruling, viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to that ruling, and frankly acknowledged that if they erred, it would be in favor of certification. See, e.g., Health & Tennis Corp. of Am. v. Jackson, 928 S.W.2d 583, 587 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1996, writ dism\\'d w.o.j.); Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Kirkland, 917 S.W.2d 836, 839, 843 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ). Still others have postulated that because a settlement or a verdict for the defendant on the common issues could end the litigation before any individual issues would be raised, predominance need not be evaluated until later. See, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v. Sheldon, 965 S.W.2d 65, 72 (Tex. App.-Austin 1998), rev\\'d, 22 S.W.3d 444 (Tex.2000); Union Pac. Resources Co. v. Chilek, 966 S.W.2d 117, 123 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, pet. dism\\'d w.o.j.). Other courts have suggested that the predominance requirement is not really a preliminary requirement at all because a class can always later be decertified if individual *435 issues are not ultimately resolved. See National Gypsum Co. v. Kirbyville Indep. Sch. Dist., 770 S.W.2d 621, 627 (Tex. App.-Beaumont 1989, writ dism\\'d w.o.j.) (\"There can be no danger in this proceeding to Appellant for the trial court recognized in his order that individual issues would have to be addressed, and stated, `This certification, of course, may be altered, amended or withdrawn at any time before final judgment.\\'\"); Life Ins. Co. v. Brister, 722 S.W.2d 764, 775 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1986, no writ) (suggesting that when predominance is in doubt, \"the most efficient approach for the trial court is to allow class certification at the present time subject to a motion by the defendants after the case has developed to dissolve the class on the grounds that common questions are not predominant at trial.\").',\n",
       "  'We reject this approach of certify now and worry later. In Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, the United States Supreme Court reemphasized the importance of vigorously applying the predominance requirement in a class-action certification that sought global settlement of current and future asbestos-related claims. There the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of carefully scrutinizing the predominance standard to ensure that the proposed class is \"sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\" Amchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 623, 117 S. Ct. 2231. Noting that \"the predominance criterion is far more demanding\" than the commonality requirement, the Court determined that the plaintiffs\\' shared experience of asbestos exposure might meet the commonality requirement, but failed to predominate over individual issues. Amchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 623, 117 S. Ct. 2231. In effect, the exacting standards of the predominance inquiry act as a check on the flexible commonality test under Rule 42(a)(2).',\n",

Although it may not be an abuse of discretion to certify a class that could later fail, we conclude that a cautious approach to class certification is essential. The \"flexibility\" of Rule 42 \"enhances the usefulness of the class-action device, [but] actual, not presumed, conformance with [the Rule] remains ... indispensable.\" Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160, 102 S.

A trial court\\'s certification order must indicate how the claims will likely be tried so that conformance with Rule 42 may be meaningfully evaluated. \"Given the plaintiffs\\' burden, a court cannot rely on [mere] assurances of counsel that any problems with predominance or superiority can be overcome.\" Castano, 84 F.3d at 742. To make a proper analysis, \"[g]oing beyond the pleadings is necessary, as a court must understand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.\" Castano, 84 F.3d at 744.

Some were inside their homes, others were outside; some were walking, others were driving. One representative, in fact, admitted that he did not think he was exposed to anything from the tank fire and explosion.

Plaintiffs\\' counsel concede that there are class members who were not or who do not think they were exposed. One of the class members, for example, was in a Beaumont prison when the explosion occurred. Another was in California.

If Southwestern chooses to challenge the credibility of and its responsibility for each personal injury claim individually, then what may nominally be a class action initially would degenerate in practice into multiple lawsuits separately tried. We therefore conclude that Rule 42(b)(4)\\'s requirement that class treatment be superior to other available *438 methods for a fair and efficient adjudication has not been satisfied.',\n",

See, e.g., David Rosenberg, Class Actions for Mass Torts: Doing Individual Justice by Collective Means, 62 INDIANA L.J. 561, 567 (1987) (arguing that \"bureaucratic justice implemented through class actions provides better opportunities for achieving individual justice than does the tort system\\'s private law, disaggregative processes\"); Samuel Issacharoff, Administering Damage Awards in Mass-Tort Litigation, 10 REV. LITIG. 463, 493 (1991) (\"The legal system is now beginning to confront the conflict between idealized forms of case-by-case adjudication and the reality of injured parties\\' regularly dying before the litigation of their claims. Against this backdrop of justice routinely denied, proposals for rough-cut justice dispensed on a mass scale must be taken seriously.\"). Indeed, under intense pressure to manage their mass-tort dockets, some trial courts have dispensed with proof requirements for certain elements and sharply limited defendants\\' rights to contest plaintiffs\\' claims, only to be reversed on appeal. See Roger H. Transgrud, Mass Trials in Mass Tort Cases: A Dissent, 1989 U. III. L.Rev. 69, 84-85 (illustrating how mass trials create incentives for improper behavior and decisions by trial judges). For example, in Cimino v. Raymark Industries, Inc., 151 F.3d 297, 304 (5th Cir.1998), the trial court certified a class of 2,298 asbestos cases and implemented a trial plan in which the trial court planned to award damages for 2,128 cases based on an extrapolation of jury awards for 160 sample cases. Moreover, the trial court refused to allow defendants to contest exposure or causation for the 160 sample cases. See Cimino, 151 F.3d at 304-05 & n. 16. Instead, the trial court instructed the jury to assume that each plaintiff had sufficient exposure to be a producing cause of an asbestos-related injury. See Cimino, 151 F.3d at 304-05 & n. 16. In short, defendants were not permitted to contest individual exposure or causation issues for any of the 2,288 nonrepresentative class members and the 160 sample cases. On an appeal from a judgment rendered in 159 of the cases, the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the trial plan violated defendants\\' Seventh Amendment rights and violated Texas\\'s substantive law. See Cimino, 151 F.3d at 311-321; see also Leverence v. PFS Corp., 193 Wis. 2d 317, 532 N.W.2d 735, 739-40 (1995) (reversing judgment in which trial court, over defendants\\' objections, used aggregative procedures on issues of cause, contributory negligence, and damages in place of individualized jury determination).',\n",
       "  'Aggregating claims can dramatically alter substantive tort jurisprudence. Under the traditional tort model, recovery is conditioned on defendant responsibility. The plaintiff must prove, and the defendant must be given the opportunity to contest, every element of a claim. By removing individual considerations from the adversarial process, the tort system is shorn of a valuable method for screening out marginal and unfounded claims. In this way, \"[c]lass certification magnifies and strengthens the number of unmeritorious claims.\" Castano, 84 F.3d at 746; see also John A.

At oral argument, *439 plaintiffs\\' counsel stated that \"we have injuries that probably do not exceed, for any of the plaintiffs on an individual basis, a thousand dollars.\" Plaintiffs urge that the most compelling reason to certify a class action is the existence of a \"negative value\" suit, in which the cost of litigating each individual claim would surpass any potential recovery.

Such a procedure forces two juries to evaluate discreet issues out of context and without knowledge of all the evidence. This procedure can also lead to inconsistent verdicts between class members. Moreover, the common and individual issues may be so interwoven that the litigants would have to present much of the same evidence to both juries, wasting the court\\'s time and the litigants\\' money. This is particularly true with splitting causation into general and specific components. One commentator has stated that mass trials on the issue of general causation create substantial savings only when the plaintiffs lose because this leads immediately to the dismissal of large numbers of mass tort claims. See Roger H. Trangsrud, Mass Trials in Mass Tort Cases: A Dissent, 1989 U. ILL. L.REV. 69, 79. This commentator observed that if the first jury finds general causation, for example, that the defendant\\'s product could have caused the plaintiff\\'s injury, individual trials will still be necessary, and therefore little or no time and expense is saved.

Although generic causation and individual circumstances concerning each plaintiff and his or her exposure to Agent Orange thus appear to be inextricably intertwined, the class action would have allowed generic causation to be determined without regard to those characteristics and the individual's exposure.\",\n",

But, in my view, having separate juries decide different phases of this personal injury case is not a viable option. First, the jury considering the trial\\'s phase IV would need to consider general causation evidence to evaluate whether and to what extent the toxic smoke was the specific cause of a particular claimant\\'s injuries. This would negate any savings that might be achieved by having the first jury decide general causation.',\n",

But frustration at not being able to reach the merits of every important case is not a sufficient reason to fail to exercise judicial restraint.

We held in Moriel that, if requested, a trial court should not permit the jury to hear evidence about punitive damages, including a defendant\\'s net worth, before liability and actual damages have been submitted to the jury.[5] The Court supports its conflicts conclusion here with the observation that \"the form of this lawsuit, per se, is not a material factual difference that distinguishes the principles we announced in Moriel.\"[6] That may be so, but it has nothing to do with whether, had the same court issued both Moriel and the court of appeals\\' opinion here, the latter would *442 overrule the former. No plausible reading of the court of appeals\\' opinion would lead to that conclusion.',\n",

Because, the Court tells us today, punitive damages have to be proportional to actual damages: \"In Moriel we were concerned that existing procedures failed to ensure that punitive damage awards `are not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense and have some understandable relationship to compensatory damages.\\'\"[9] And why did the court of appeals determine in this case that the trial court\\'s trial plan was an abuse of discretion? Because, the court of appeals told us in its opinion, punitive damages have to be proportional to actual damages: \"The certification order in this case does not provide any mechanism for the jury to become familiar with the sort of actual damages present in this case prior to the jury\\'s determination of punitive damages. Such an arrangement is prohibited ... because it provides no way for punitive damages to be reasonably proportional to actual damages.\"[10]',\n",

This plan still allows the jury to resolve the common issue of punitive damages relatively early in the litigation, but also allows the jury to have an understanding of the extent of actual damages suffered by a class before assessing punitive damages.[12]',\n",

McKeown and Sandra S. Shaffar, and a former customer, News America Publishing, Inc., in August 1993 for breach of contract, tortious interference with business relations, and other claims. (USSI has sued others not involved in the matter before us, and we do not include them in referring to \"the defendants\".) USSI alleged that for years it had provided software systems and computer services to News America, but that after Frazier, McKeown, and Shaffar left USSI, the three went to work for News America and systematically began to destroy USSI\\'s business relationship with News America. USSI was represented by lawyers at the firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, including Karen Gulde. Defendants were all represented by Mark Cannan.',\n",
       "  \"In May 1995, nearly twenty-one months after suit was filed, Landreth telephoned Frazier to propose a meeting at Akin Gump's offices to discuss their differences *333 in the litigation. Frazier accepted. (Landreth also called Shaffar, but she refused to discuss the lawsuit with him.) At the meeting, Frazier presented Gulde with a letter referencing the pending litigation, which stated:\",\n",
       "  'Dear Ms. Gulde:',\n",
       "  'This is to inform you that I desire to meet with you today to discuss the above-referenced lawsuit without the assistance of counsel. Prior to meeting with you, I decided to terminate my representation by Mark Cannan. Therefore, I hereby state that I am no longer represented by any attorney in this matter, and I do not desire to be represented by counsel in connection with my discussions with you, Ron Landreth, and any of the attorneys for Plaintiffs in this case.',\n",

       "  '      s/ Donald Ray Frazier',\n",
       "  \"Based on this letter, Gulde agreed to participate in the discussions between Frazier and Landreth. During the meeting, Frazier gave Landreth a handwritten statement describing certain events leading up to News America's limiting its relationship with USSI. Landreth and Gulde did not reach a settlement with Frazier at the meeting, but later that day Gulde filed a nonsuit of all USSI's claims against him.\",\n",
       "  \"Neither Gulde nor Landreth ever attempted to contact Cannan\\x97either before meeting with Frazier, or after nonsuiting him\\x97to ask whether he was aware that Frazier had terminated his representation. In fact, Cannan did not know because Frazier had never spoken with him about the matter. Even when Cannan called Frazier about the nonsuit, Frazier did not tell him that he wanted to terminate their relationship. Thus, the court file reflects that Cannan was Frazier's counsel of record when the nonsuit was filed. Not until January 1996, while deposing Landreth, did Cannan learn of the May meeting, Frazier's letter to Gulde, and Frazier's handwritten statement.\",\n",
       "  'Cannan took no immediate action in response to Landreth\\'s testimony. In June, USSI supplemented its interrogatory answers to identify Frazier as one of its expert witnesses. In July, Cannan again deposed Landreth, who reconfirmed his earlier testimony concerning his meeting with Frazier. Then, in August, a little more than four months before a January 1997 trial setting, defendants News America, McKeown, and Shaffar moved to sanction USSI by disqualifying the Akin Gump firm from representing USSI further, based on Gulde\\'s violation of Rule 4.02(a). At the hearing on the motion, Cannan complained specifically that he had not been contacted before the meeting with Frazier. \"Frankly,\" Cannan told the court, \"we [he and Akin Gump] are in the same building. I rather suspect that if a phone call had been made and Frazier took the elevator for two or three floors to my office and told me, `You\\'re fired, I\\'m gonna go talk to these people,\\' everything would have been copacetic, I suppose....\" At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court denied defendants\\' motion.',\n",
       "  'Defendants petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Fourth District of Texas for mandamus relief. A panel of the court issued an opinion conditionally granting a writ of mandamus. On rehearing en banc, the court issued a new opinion reaching the same conclusion, but over the dissent of three of the seven Justices.[3] The court reasoned that the Landreth-Frazier meeting \"at the law firm in the presence of a firm attorney can only be interpreted as an encouragement\" of communications prohibited by Rule 4.02.[4] The court was concerned that Frazier made the decision to defect to USSI\\'s side of the lawsuit without benefit of counsel.[5] The court was also troubled that Cannan\\'s responsibilities as *334 counsel of record under Rules 8 and 10 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure could not be terminated by Frazier\\'s letter to Gulde but only by notice to the trial court, which was not given, so that Cannan remained Frazier\\'s counsel of record during the meeting with Landreth and Gulde.[6] Relying principally on Formal Opinion 95-396 of the American Bar Association Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility,[7] the court concluded that \"the spirit of [Rule 4.02] requires the ethical lawyer to avoid such communications when in a litigation setting for as long as counsel for that other party has not officially withdrawn from representation.\"[8] Deciding that Akin Gump\\'s conduct had harmed not only the defendants but the legal profession by placing Cannan \"in the untenable position of attacking a former client and accusing opposing counsel of unethical behavior in front of a jury\",[9] the court held that mandamus relief was necessary to direct the district court to order Akin Gump disqualified from representing USSI.[10] The dissent, stressing that Frazier had made his decision to terminate Cannan freely and had not complained that Landreth or Gulde had taken advantage of him, argued that Gulde did not violate Rule 4.02.[11]',\n",

Here, however, the parties and the lower courts have all focused the issue of whether Akin Gump should be disqualified from representing USSI on Rule 4.02; hence, so do we.',\n",
       "  'Rule 4.02 forbids a lawyer from communicating with another person only if the lawyer knows the person has legal counsel in the matter. Before meeting with Frazier, Gulde knew he was represented by Cannan, but after Frazier gave Gulde his letter, there is no evidence that Gulde knew Frazier was represented by anyone. Defendants do not argue that Gulde had any reason to disbelieve Frazier. The one possible ambiguity in Frazier\\'s letter\\x97that prior to the meeting he had \"decided\" to terminate Cannan\\'s representation, not that he had actually done it\\x97is resolved by his unequivocal statement in the letter, \"I am no longer represented by any attorney in this matter, and I do not desire to be represented by counsel in connection with my discussions with you\".',\n",
       "  \"Having no reason to doubt Frazier's statement, Gulde was not required to call Cannan before talking with Frazier. Rule 4.02 does not require an attorney to contact a person's former attorney to confirm the person's statement that representation has been terminated before communicating with the person. Confirmation *335 may be necessary in some circumstances before an attorney can determine whether a person is no longer represented, but it is not required by Rule 4.02 in every situation, and for good reason. The attorney may not be able to provide confirmation if, as in this case, he and his client have not communicated. And while a client should certainly be expected to communicate with his attorney about discontinuing representation, the client in some circumstances may have reasons for not doing so immediately. Frazier, for example, may not have wanted his co-defendants to know of his decision to meet with Landreth and Gulde for fear that they might try to dissuade or deter him. But whether he had a good reason or not, Frazier was not required to tell Cannan that their relationship was terminated before Gulde could meet with Frazier without violating Rule 4.02. A client can discharge an attorney at any time, with or without cause.[14] Of course, a client's delay in telling his attorney that his representation has terminated may have other consequences. The client may be liable for work the lawyer continues to do for him, not realizing that his services have been terminated.[15] The client may also be bound by the attorney's actions done in the good faith belief that he continued to represent the client.[16]\",\n",
       "  'Nor is the client\\'s right to terminate the relationship limited by the attorney\\'s responsibilities to a court as counsel of record for the client. Rule 8 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes a party\\'s \"attorney in charge\" \"responsible for the suit as to such party\",[17] and Rule 10 specifies when and how counsel may withdraw.[18] But neither rule speaks to the client\\'s right to terminate the representation or requires that notice first be given to the court. On the other hand, the procedure prescribed by Rule 12 for requiring an attorney to show his authority to act for a party[19] presupposes the possibility that an attorney can be counsel of record for a party he is not authorized to represent. The rules contemplate that authorization may not have existed or may cease before the attorney has withdrawn from the case.',\n",
       "  \"None of the cases cited by the court of appeals support its conclusion that a communication with a person who has terminated his lawyer's services unbeknownst to that lawyer violates Rule 4.02, and defendants point us to no other cases. In each of the cases cited an attorney communicated with a party who was at the time represented by counsel. The only other authority offered for disqualification is Formal Opinion 95-396 of the American Bar Association Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility.[20] That opinion states the following rule:\",\n",
       "  'When contact is initiated by a person who is known to have been represented by counsel in the matter but who declares that the representation has been or will be terminated, the communicating lawyer should not proceed without *336 reasonable assurance that the representation has in fact been terminated[.][21]',\n",
       "  'The opinion then explains:',\n",
       "  'Of course, any represented person retains the right to terminate the representation. In the event that such a termination has occurred, the communicating lawyer is free to communicate with, and to respond to communications from, the former represented person....',\n",
       "  'As a practical matter, a sensible course for the communicating lawyer would generally be to confirm whether in fact the representing lawyer has been effectively discharged. For example, the lawyer might ask the person to provide evidence that the lawyer has been dismissed. The communicating lawyer can also contact the representing lawyer directly to determine whether she has been informed of the discharge. The communicating lawyer may also choose to inform the person that she does not wish to communicate further until he gets another lawyer.',\n",
       "  'There are some circumstances where the communicating lawyer may need to go beyond determining that the person has discharged her lawyer.... [I]f retained counsel has entered an appearance in a matter, whether civil or criminal, and remains counsel of record, with corresponding responsibilities, the communicating lawyer may not communicate with the person until the lawyer has withdrawn her appearance.[22]',\n",
       "  'We agree, of course, that confirmation of termination of representation may be a \"sensible course\" in many instances, but that does not make it a prerequisite to communication in every instance under Rule 4.02. We disagree, for reasons already explained, that communication concerning litigation is not allowed if a party\\'s former lawyer has not withdrawn his appearance. The ABA opinion cites authority for other statements but none for this one.',\n",
       "  'Accordingly, we conclude on the record before us that Akin Gump cannot be disqualified for violating Rule 4.02 because it did not violate that rule. Even if Akin Gump violated the \"spirit\" of the rule, as the court of appeals suggested,[23] Gulde\\'s actions did not cause any prejudice that would require disqualification. The court of appeals reasoned that \"confidential information has likely been disclosed to an opposing party\".[24] The court may have had in mind that Frazier might have disclosed to Gulde information his co-defendants could claim to be privileged. Although as we said in In re Meador, \"there are situations where a lawyer who has been privy to privileged information improperly obtained from the other side must be disqualified, even though the lawyer was not involved in obtaining the information\",[25] defendants have not met Meador `s requirements for showing this case to be such a situation. The court of appeals also reasoned:',\n",
       "  'should Frazier be permitted to testify on behalf of the plaintiffs at trial, the defense is placed in the untenable position of attacking a former client and accusing opposing counsel of unethical behavior in front of a jury. All of this will do harm to the legal profession in the eyes of the public and particularly in the eyes of those citizens performing their civic duty as members of the jury in this case.[26]',\n",
       "  'But as long as Frazier chooses to align with USSI, the conflict with defendants cannot be avoided by disqualifying Akin Gump. And as we have already concluded, Akin Gump has not behaved unethically in *337 meeting with Frazier. In sum, the prejudice identified by the court of appeals either does not exist or is not grounds for disqualification. As Cannan told the district court, if only he had been told of Frazier\\'s decision before the meeting, \"everything would have been copacetic\".',\n",
       "  \"Finally, we note that defendants did not move to disqualify Akin Gump until almost seven months after they learned of the meeting between Frazier and Gulde. Mandamus relief, which is largely controlled by equitable principles, may be denied a party for lack of diligence.[27] In Rivercenter Associates v. Rivera, we held that a party's unexplained four-month delay in asserting its rights showed a lack of diligence that made mandamus relief unwarranted.[28] Cannan argues that he delayed in filing a motion to disqualify Akin Gump until after Landreth's deposition was reconvened because he did not want to accuse Akin Gump of unethical conduct before giving Landreth an opportunity to amend or augment his testimony about the meeting. USSI does not argue, and the district court did not find, that defendants were dilatory in moving to disqualify. A court need not afford mandamus relief to a dilatory party even if an opposing party does not assert lack of diligence as a ground for denying relief. But since Cannan has offered some explanation of the delay, and the record on the issue is unclear, we do not address the matter of diligence.\",\n",

See Spears, 797 *338 S.W.2d at 656; Coker, 765 S.W.2d at 399. One of the requirements of that exacting standard is that a party who does not file a motion to disqualify opposing counsel in a timely manner waives the complaint. See Grant v.

They contend that the cause of this defect was Ford\\'s removal of spray primer from the paint process as a cost-saving measure in the early 1980s. Before that time, Ford applied low-build electrocoat to sheet metal and then sprayed a primer before adding the enamel topcoat. Under the new process, which was adopted for F-Series Trucks, Broncos, Bronco IIs, Rangers, and Mustangs, Ford replaced low-build electrocoat with medium- or high-build electrocoat and then applied the topcoat directly to the electrocoat. Purchasers argue that, because electrocoat is not weather-resistant, removing the primer from the paint process caused the paint on many vehicles to delaminate. When exposed to ultraviolet sunlight, the enamel *448 paint coat could separate from the vehicle\\'s metal surface within 18 to 36 months. Purchasers assert that Ford learned of the alleged defect within a few years after adopting the new paint process, but continued to use it until the early 1990s, selling the affected cars to Texas consumers while consciously concealing the problem.[1]',\n",

El Paso County, 136 Tex. 370, 150 S.W.2d 1000, 1001 (1941). Thus, the purposes underlying Section 56 are \"`to prevent the granting of special privileges and to secure uniformity of law throughout the state as far as possible.\\'\" Maple Run, 931 S.W.2d at 945 (quoting Miller, 150 S.W.2d at 1001). Purchasers argue that Section 6.06(g) violates these purposes because it gives car manufacturers and dealers a \"special privilege\" not granted to other litigants and \"also eliminates the uniformity of the law on interlocutory class certification appeals.\"',\n",

       "  'We conclude that there is a reasonable basis for distinguishing class actions involving motor vehicle licensees from other class actions and that Section 6.06(g) operates equally on all within the class. First, \"[a] statute is not local or special ... if it operates on a subject in which people at large are interested.\" Langdeau v. Bouknight, 162 Tex. 42, 344 S.W.2d 435, 441 (1961); accord Smith v.

Automobiles and related issues such as automobile safety are important subjects to the public. Automobiles are the primary means of transportation for most people; many, if not most, travel many thousands of miles each year and hence spend hundreds of hours each year in an automobile. In fact, acquiring an automobile is one of the largest and most important purchases that many consumers will make.[4] As a result, automobiles have often been the subject matter of Texas class action suits. See, e.g., General Motors Corp. v. Brewer, 966 S.W.2d 56 (Tex.1998); General Motors Corp. v. Bloyed, 916 S.W.2d 949 (Tex.1996); Brookshire v. Longhorn Chevrolet Co., 788 S.W.2d 209 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1990, no writ). Thus, it is reasonable for the Legislature to ensure heightened judicial scrutiny of these class actions that affect so many individuals. This justification is sufficient to sustain Section 6.06(g) against constitutional challenge. See Inman v. Railroad Comm\\'n, 478 S.W.2d 124, 127 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1972, writ ref\\'d n.r.e.).',\n",
       "  'Second, Section 6.06(g) applies uniformly to all members of the affected class, as any party to a class action suit involving a licensee may assert a claim thereunder. Under the circumstances, Section 6.06(g) is not a special law that violates Article III, Section 56 of the Texas Constitution.',\n",
       "  'Purchasers also argue that Section 6.06(g) violates Article I, Sections 3 and 3a of the Texas Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution providing for equal protection under the laws. U.S. CONST. amend. XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 3a. As we stated in Trinity River Authority v. URS Consultants, Inc., 889 S.W.2d 259, 264 (Tex.1994): \"Both the state and federal equal protection guarantees require a similar multi-tiered analysis. Where the classification does not impinge on a fundamental right, or distinguish between persons on a suspect basis such as race or national origin, it is valid as long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.\" (citations omitted). Section 6.06(g)\\'s classification does not impinge on a fundamental right. We have already decided that there is a rational basis for allowing parties to a class action involving a motor vehicle licensee to seek this Court\\'s review of a class certification order. We therefore conclude that the provision does not violate the equal protection *452 guarantees of either the federal or the state constitution.',\n",
       "  'Finally, Purchasers claim that Section 6.06(g) violates Article III, Section 35 of the Texas Constitution, which requires that \"the subject of each bill be expressed in its title in a manner that gives the legislature and the public reasonable notice of that subject.\" TEX. CONST. art. III, § 35(b). But in 1986, the people amended this section to further provide that \"[t]he legislature is solely responsible for determining compliance with the rule\" and that \"a law ... may not be held void on the basis of an insufficient title.\" TEX. CONST. art. III, § 35(b), (c). Thus, laws will no longer be struck down because of a deficiency in title, no matter how egregious. See Baggett v. State, 722 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex.Crim.App.1987) (determining that a court \"no longer has the power to declare an act of the legislature unconstitutional due to the insufficiency of its caption\").',\n",

This Court does not have jurisdiction to review the court of appeals' judgment unless there is a dissent in the court of appeals' opinion or the court of appeals' decision conflicts with a decision of this Court or another court of appeals. See TEX. GOV'T CODE §§ 22.225(b)(5),(c); 22.001(a)(1),(2). But in 1997, the Legislature enacted section 6.06(g) of the Texas Motor Vehicle Commission Code, which gives the Supreme Court jurisdiction to review interlocutory appeals of class certification decisions, regardless of dissent or conflict, when a motor vehicle licensee is a party. See TEX. REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 6.06(g). Motor vehicle licensees include automobile dealers, manufacturers, converters, representatives, lessors, lease facilitators, and those who perform or offer to perform repair services on a motor vehicle. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 1.03(20), 4.01(a). Thus, section 6.06(g) carves out an exception to the statutory rule for parties that are members of any of the above categories. Section 6.06(g)'s classification is broad enough to include a numerically substantial class, but because the classification has no reasonable basis, it is an unconstitutional special law.\",\n",
       "  \"There is nothing in section 6.06(g), its sparse legislative history, or the parties' arguments that hint at a reasonable basis for providing Supreme Court review of interlocutory class certification decisions involving motor vehicle licensees and not providing it for any other class litigant. Nor can I conceive of a reasonable basis. Any difference between class certification decisions involving motor vehicle licensees and decisions involving insurance companies, computer companies, oil companies, tax preparers, hospitals, credit card companies, investment companies, accounting firms, and any entity providing important consumer goods and services does not warrant an exclusive right to Supreme Court review. There is nothing unique about 6.06(g) cases other than the presence of a *457 motor vehicle licensee. That presence makes no difference in class certification decisions, and therefore, should not make a difference in the appellate review available.\",\n",
       "  \"Although class certification is a fact-intensive inquiry, the class certification requirements are the same regardless of the underlying subject matter or the parties' identities. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 42. Professor Newburg makes this point while discussing the different categories of tort class actions. See NEWBURG, NEWBURG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 17.06 (1992). He points out that class treatment will depend chiefly on applying the class certification requirements rather than on whether the suit is a mass accident, toxic tort, or products liability case. See Newburg, Newburg on Class Actions § 17.06 (1992). Review of class certification also depends on applying the class certification requirements, rather than the subject matter or parties involved.

Residential property owners had sued the owners of a lead smelter, claiming that airborne lead emissions caused personal injury and property damage. See RSR, 673 S.W.2d at 929. The owners alleged a variety of damages and several theories of liability. See RSR, 673 S.W.2d at 932-33. The trial court certified a class that included all property owners living within a two-mile radius from the smelter. See RSR, 673 S.W.2d at 929. The court of appeals reversed, holding that common issues did not predominate because some owners did not suffer any injury, the personal injuries alleged differed for each class member, and because the owners had asserted various theories of liability that could be answered differently among class members. See RSR, 673 S.W.2d at 932-33.',\n",
       "  '*459 Here, the court of appeals held that four questions were common to the class: (1) whether the paint process was defective because it lacks spray primer; (2) whether Ford knew of the defect; (3) whether Ford had a duty to disclose the defect; and (4) how the discovery rule applied. The court distinguished RSR by noting that the RSR class was much broader because it included various types of injuries and included all landowners without regard to whether lead was on their land. Here, the class members allege one type of damage and the class only includes cars that had peeling paint.',\n",
       "  \"I do not agree with Ford that the alleged conflict between RSR and the court of appeals' opinion in this case meets the standards for conflicts jurisdiction. First, Ford alleges this case conflicts on whether issues are common to the class under Rule 42(a)(2). But the actual question considered and decided in RSR was whether common issues predominated under Rule 42(b)(4). In short, the courts of appeals in RSR and in this case did not hold differently on the same question of law. See Coastal Corp., 979 S.W.2d at 322. Furthermore, the RSR parties asserted numerous causes of action. Here, the parties assert only one. Additionally, RSR involved certification of personal injury claims in addition to property claims. See RSR, 673 S.W.2d at 932. This Court has noted that courts should distinguish personal injury mass tort actions from property damage class actions. See Coastal Corp., 979 S.W.2d at 321. Finally, there was undisputed evidence in RSR that 70% of the class members within the defined geographic area did not have hazardous levels of lead on their land. See RSR, 673 S.W.2d at 931. Here, the court of appeals limited the class to people whose cars had peeling paint. For these reasons, we do not have conflicts jurisdiction in this case based on RSR.\",\n",

The court noted that in consumer actions where the alleged misrepresentations vary with each transaction, individual issues would likely predominate and a class action would not be proper. See Brister, 722 S.W.2d at 774. The court held that the test for whether common questions predominate is not whether common questions outnumber the individual ones, but instead whether common issues will be the object of most of the litigants' and court's efforts.

Further, the court in Brister and the court of appeals in this case agree that the test of whether common issues predominate is whether common or individual issues will be the object of litigant's efforts rather than the number of common or individual issues.

See Otis Elevator, 776 S.W.2d at 153. Partial remand is only permissible where the issues are severable. See Otis Elevator, 776 S.W.2d at 153. Similarly, in Iley, this Court held that liability and damages issues could not be tried separately in a personal injury case. See Iley, 311 S.W.2d at 651. Likewise, Eubanks expresses Texas courts' aversion to piecemeal trials. See Eubanks, 420 S.W.2d at 701 (holding that a court could not grant a new trial on liability, allow the defendant to confess liability, and then award damages under the original verdict because that severed contested issues of liability and damages in a personal injury case).\",\n",
       "  'This case differs from Iley, Otis Elevator, and Eubanks in several key aspects. Most importantly, this case is a property damage case but all the cases Ford cites are personal injury cases. Courts and commentators have recognized that special considerations exist when juries consider liability and damages separately in a personal injury case. See Iley, 311 S.W.2d at 650-51; see also 9 CHARLES ALLEN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2390, at 508 (1995). Futhermore, here the court of appeals did not find that the trial court had entirely separated liability and damages because the certification order did not mention bifurcating *461 the trial. See 965 S.W.2d at 68 n. 2. Rather, the court of appeals assumed, and the parties agreed, that some bifurcation would be necessary in this class action. See 965 S.W.2d at 68 n. 2. The court of appeals decided that the individual trials would likely include aspects of liability and damages together so the bifurcation would be permissible. See 965 S.W.2d at 69. This decision does not deal directly with the types of bifurcation considered in Iley, Eubanks, and Otis Elevator. Because of these differences, Ford cannot demonstrate a \"well-defined\" and direct conflict between this case and Iley, Eubanks, or Otis Elevator to establish conflicts jurisdiction. See Coultress, 179 S.W. at 516-17.',\n",

In Zrubeck, the trial court bifurcated the exemplary damages part of a personal injury case. See Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d at 581. Eleven jurors found the defendant negligent and awarded actual damages. See Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d at 584. In the second part of the trial, ten jurors, including the one who voted against liability in the first phase, found exemplary damages. See Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d at 581. The court of appeals held that the defendant failed to preserve error on that issue. See Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d at 581. In dicta, the court commented that because this was a \"separate\" trial, the same ten jurors did not have to agree on liability and damages. See Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d at 581.

The court of appeals disagreed and held that the class definition did not contain vague terms. See Kirkland, 917 S.W.2d at 840. Rather, class membership could be easily ascertained through company records. See Kirkland, 917 S.W.2d at 840. The court noted in dicta that class definitions in other cases were vague because the definitions contained terms relating to the plaintiff's state of mind. See Kirkland, 917 S.W.2d at 840.

Nash sold the policies as independent agent for the insurance companies under an Agency-Company Agreement. Between January 1981 and November 1984, dissatisfied customers of Burns Motors sued the auto dealership in four lawsuits. While defending these lawsuits, Burns Motors learned that the polices it had purchased from Gulf and Select did not cover the liability alleged in these suits or the cost of defending them. Burns Motors did not sue either insurance company, but instead it sued Nash individually and his agency, claiming that Nash knowingly misrepresented the insurance coverage he sold to Burns Motors. Burns Motors alleged that Nash was liable for breach of a fiduciary duty, common law negligence, common law fraud, violations under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and violations of article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code. Burns Motors sought actual damages for defending and settling the customers' suits, and further alleged that Nash's misrepresentations had been made knowingly as that term was defined in section 17.45(9) of the DTPA at the time of suit.\",\n",
       "  \"The DTPA lawsuit against Nash had been pending for four years when he appeared pro se and agreed to a judgment against him. The agreed judgment found Nash liable for $75,208.65 in actual damages, which equated the damages awarded Burns Motors' dissatisfied customers in the four lawsuits, $150,417.30 additional damages under the DTPA, and $25,000 for attorney's fees. Thus, the total award under the agreed judgment was $250,625.95. After the trial court rendered the agreed judgment, Nash assigned to Burns Motors all present and future claims that Nash could assert against Gulf and Select for contribution or indemnity under the Agency-Company Agreement. Furthermore, according to Nash's deposition testimony in the record, Burns Motors and Nash entered into a covenant not to execute on the agreed judgment.\",\n",
       "  \"Burns Motors, as Nash's assignee, then sued Gulf and Select for all sums that *420 Nash was obligated to pay under the agreed judgment. Gulf and Select moved for summary judgment, contending, among other grounds, that the Agency-Company Agreement excluded indemnification for an agent's knowing misrepresentations and that the assignment of the cause of action from Nash to Burns Motors was collusive and barred as against public policy. The trial court granted the motion without specifying the grounds and rendered a take-nothing judgment for Gulf and Select.\",\n",

The court determined that the ambiguity created a question of fact about the contractual indemnity provision that precluded summary judgment. 975 S.W.2d at 814-15. The court of appeals also concluded that Nash's assignment to Burns Motors was not void as against public policy. 975 S.W.2d at 815-16.

The court of appeals concluded that the fact that Nash passed on the misrepresentation to Burns Motors could but did not necessarily mean that he \"caused, contributed to or compounded the error.\" 975 S.W.2d at 814. Thus, the court of appeals determined that the Agency-Company Agreement was ambiguous about whether the parties intended to indemnify Nash under these circumstances, and that this ambiguity created a fact question precluding summary judgment. 975 S.W.2d at 814-15.',\n",

Burns Motors contends that Nash could not have understood the legal definition of \"knowingly\" under the DTPA because he is a layman and was not represented by counsel when the parties made the agreed judgment. According to Burns Motors, Nash\\'s testimony at the hearing before the trial court signed the agreed judgment also demonstrates that Nash did not intend to use the term knowingly in its technical sense. In that testimony, Nash stated that he believed the representations that he was making to Burns Motors were true when he made them and that the insurance companies owed coverage in the *422 dissatisfied customer suits.

Thus, the court will examine and consider the entire instrument so that none of the provisions will be rendered meaningless. See R & P Enters. v.

The agreed judgment awarded Burns Motors additional damages as the DTPA authorized. The DTPA, as it read in 1991 when the agreed judgment was rendered, authorized additional damages not to exceed three times the amount of actual damages in excess of $1000 to a consumer who prevailed and obtained a finding from the trier of fact that the conduct of the defendant was committed knowingly.

In other words, Nash made all the representations to Burns Motors knowing they were false.',\n",

Burns Motors sought treble damages against Nash under the DTPA because, it alleged, Nash knowingly misrepresented coverage.

As we said earlier, the court of appeals held that \"Gulf and Select\\'s alleged error in misrepresenting coverage questions to Nash that were then passed on to Burns as a potential purchaser could well amount to an error in handling business by Gulf and Select.\" 975 S.W.2d at 814. Because Gulf and Select do not contest the court of appeals\\' conclusion, we assume for purposes of construing this indemnity provision, but do not decide, that an intentional misrepresentation of coverage by the insurance companies constitutes an error by the company in handling business. Concluding that the requirements for indemnification have been satisfied, we must now determine how the exception to indemnity coverage applies here.',\n",

       "  'Burns Motors asserts that it should be indemnified under the Agency-Company Agreement based upon the agreed judgment rendered against Nash. But the agreed judgment established that Nash knowingly made the representations as defined by the DTPA. Thus, Nash knew that the representations he made to Burns Motors were either false, deceptive or unfair. Further, all of the misrepresentations that were made by Nash were made knowingly. Thus, there are no representations that Nash passed on innocently. Because Nash knowingly misrepresented all of the false statements made to Burns Motors, and because there is nothing in the record to show that Burns Motors did not rely solely on Nash\\'s misrepresentations, we conclude that Nash fully \"caused, contributed to or compounded\" the error that caused Burns Motors damages. Thus, as a matter of law we hold that the Agency-Company Agreement language is not ambiguous and that the parties did not intend that the insurance companies would indemnify their agent who knowingly made misrepresentations about insurance coverage.',\n",
       "  'The parties argue extensively about whether we should construe the Agency-Company Agreement by reference to the express negligence doctrine.

Co., 725 S.W.2d 705, 708 (Tex.1987). Further, \"the intent of the parties must be specifically stated within the four corners of the contract.\" Ethyl Corp., 725 S.W.2d at 708. Here, the Agency-Company Agreement provides that the agent is, under certain circumstances, indemnified \"except to the extent *424 Agent has caused, contributed to or compounded such error.\" Burns Motors argues that even if the indemnity provision precludes recovery for Nash\\'s wrongful conduct, it still should allow indemnity for the part of the wrong that Gulf and Select caused. Thus, Burns Motors is not asserting that Nash should be indemnified for his wrong acts but only that he should be indemnified for the part of the error that Gulf and Select caused. The Agency-Company Agreement does not contemplate indemnifying the indemnitee from consequences of his own negligence. Thus, the express negligence doctrine does not apply here.',\n",

We have, however, already concluded Nash knowingly made all the misrepresentations to Burns Motors, that he fully caused, contributed to or compounded the error that led to his liability, and that he is not entitled to indemnification.

The broadcast triggered a dispute between the criminal district judges and the county commissioners over access to records showing when judges entered and left their parking garage.

The court coordinator advised KTVT that Judge Pruitt would not grant the permission requested because KTVT had broadcast stories critical of judges. A KTVT film crew went to the courthouse to videotape a criminal defendant as he walked through a hallway and into Judge Pruitt\\'s courtroom. While they were there, the bailiff in Judge Pruitt\\'s court told a film crew from another television station that it could film through the back door as long as it was \"not f____ Channel 11.\" Altogether, three television stations were permitted to film through the back door, but not Channel 11.',\n",

INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 1. Because these insurers are not subject to the same restrictions as licensed insurers, the Legislature has declared that such transactions are \"a matter of public interest\" and \"a subject of concern,\" and that \"it is necessary to provide for the regulation, taxation, supervision and control of such transactions and the practices and matters related thereto.\" Id. The Legislature has therefore adopted \"reasonable and practical safeguards\" to protect consumers. Id.',\n",
       "  '*323 Among these safeguards are requirements concerning the financial security of surplus lines insurers. To be eligible to provide surplus lines insurance, an insurer must provide evidence to the State Board of Insurance that it meets strict capital and surplus requirements. See TEX.INS. CODE art. 1.14-2, § 8(b). An insurer may be exempt from these requirements if the Commissioner finds, after a public hearing, that the insurer meets certain other requirements. See id., § 8(b), (c).',\n",
       "  'Another safeguard for the consumer concerns an unauthorized insurer\\'s defense of a lawsuit. Before filing a pleading in defense of a suit, an unauthorized insurer must deposit cash, securities, or a bond \"in an amount to be determined by the court sufficient to secure the payment of any final judgment that may be rendered\" in the suit. TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.36, § 11(a)(1). The court may dispense with this requirement if the insurer establishes that it maintains in a state of the United States funds or securities that are \"sufficient and available to satisfy any final judgment\" that may be rendered in the suit. Id.',\n",
       "  'Both of these safeguards were affected by measures enacted by the Legislature in 1993. First, the Legislature increased the minimum capital and surplus requirements for surplus lines insurers to $15,000,000. Act of May 28, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 685, § 7.08, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 2559, 2614 (amending TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 8). This heightened requirement was evidently intended to ensure that an unlicensed carrier would have sufficient capital to cover any claims.',\n",

See TEX. INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 8.

Williams Brothers settled the underlying suit with Teal for a sum in excess of $600,000, but reserved its claims against Lopez-Gloria for indemnity. In June of 1992, Williams Brothers initiated this suit against Mid-American.',\n",

Thus, an erroneous interpretation of article 1.36 would constitute a clear abuse of discretion. Further, there is no adequate remedy by appeal when a trial court issues orders, such as orders striking the pleadings and rendering default judgment, that have the effect of adjudicating a dispute, but are not immediately appealable. See TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 919-20 (Tex.1991).

Mid-American argues that it falls within this exception because it undisputedly was an eligible surplus lines insurer at the date applicable coverage was issued.',\n",
       "  'We disagree. By its terms, the exception in section 11(d) applies only to surplus lines insurers who were deemed eligible at the date coverage was issued. Mid-American undisputedly is not a surplus lines insurer, as that term is presently defined. As noted above, the same 1993 legislation that created the exception in section 11(d) also defined a \"surplus lines insurer\" as \"an unlicensed insurer deemed eligible\" under article 1.14-2. TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 2(b) (emphasis added). The Legislature\\'s intent to connect these two provisions is clear; the floor report on the bill explained that \"eligible surplus lines insurers responding to legal actions should not have to post bond to ensure payment of any judgment or order.\" HOUSE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, BILL ANALYSIS, Tex. H.B. 958, 73rd Leg., R.S. (1993) (emphasis added). Thus, under the plain terms of the statute, an insurer is exempt from the bond requirement only if it is an eligible surplus lines insurer both at the time the coverage is issued and at the time it seeks to defend against a suit.',\n",
       "  'Adopting Mid-American\\'s construction of the statute would contravene the Legislature\\'s intent in two important respects. First, as noted previously, the main purpose of the legislation at issue was to clarify the distinction between eligible surplus lines insurers and unauthorized insurers. See HOUSE COMM. ON INSURANCE, BILL ANALYSIS. Tex.H.B. 958, 73rd Leg., R.S. (1993).[1] Mid-American\\'s position would require us to ignore this distinction; in effect, we would have to interpret the phrase \"surplus lines insurer\" in section 11(d) to mean \"unauthorized insurer,\" in spite of the Legislature\\'s deliberate adoption of a contrary definition in section 2(b) of article 1.14-2.[2]',\n",
       "  'Second, Mid-American\\'s position would undermine the Legislature\\'s efforts to protect Texas consumers from unauthorized insurers that lack adequate capital. As noted above, during the same session in which section 11(d) was added, the Legislature significantly increased the minimum capital and surplus requirements for surplus lines insurers. Act of May 28, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 685, § 7.08, 1993 Tex. Gen.Laws 2559, 2614 (amending TEX.INS. CODE art. 1.14-2, § 8). When the same session of the Legislature enacts two statutes dealing with the same subject matter, \"it is presumed that they were actuated by the same policy and imbued with the same spirit; and accordingly, in ascertaining the legislative intent, they will be read together, each in light of the other, as though they were embraced in one Act or were supplemental to each other.\" Garrett v. Mercantile Nat\\'l Bank, 140 Tex. 394, 168 S.W.2d 636, 637 (1943). Adopting Mid-American\\'s interpretation of section 11(d) would be directly contrary to the spirit of the heightened security requirements in article 1.14-2. Under Mid-American\\'s view, there would be a real danger that an unlicensed carrier would not have sufficient capital at the time the policy was issued, it would neither have to post any bond in court nor maintain adequate reserves.',\n",
       "  '*326 The dissenting opinion asserts that the Legislature could not have meant to limit the exemption to presently-eligible surplus lines insurers, because \"[t]he additional requirement that the insurer was an `eligible\\' surplus lines insurer at the time the coverage was issued adds little substance to the statute.\" Infra at 329. We disagree. If eligibility were not required at the beginning of the insurance relationship, the state would be encouraging ineligible insurers to issue policies and postpone meeting eligibility requirements. Section 11(d) avoids that situation by requiring eligibility both at the time a policy is issued and at the litigation stage.',\n",
       "  'The dissenting opinion also asserts that the exception in section 11(d) cannot be limited to presently-eligible surplus lines insurers because the same exception also appears in sections 7 and 8 of article 1.36. Those sections, like section 11, apply to \"unauthorized persons or insurers.\" The dissenting opinion argues that the exception as we have construed it is \"entirely unnecessary\" in sections 7 and 8, because \"[e]lligible surplus lines insurers are not `unauthorized insurers.\\'\" Infra at 330. Again, we disagree. The relevant legislative history makes plain that the term \"unauthorized\" refers to insurers who are unlicensed, not to those who are ineligible:',\n",
       "  'When Article 1.14-2 was added to the Insurance Code in 1967, the term \"unauthorized\" was used to distinguish unlicensed insurers from licensed insurers. The parties involved understood that eligible surplus lines transactions are lawful transactions by carriers licensed in other states, while unauthorized transactions are unlawful transactions by unlicensed and ineligible parties.',\n",
       "  'HOUSE COMM. ON INSURANCE, BILL ANALYSIS, Tex.H.B. 958, 73rd Leg., R.S. (1993). Thus, the general term \"unauthorized insurers\" does include eligible surplus lines insurers, because by definition such insurers are unlicensed.',\n",

State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., 163 Tex. 240, 353 S.W.2d 412, 416 (1962). Mid-American does not deny this, but it nonetheless argues that article 1.36 violates its constitutional rights in several respects. We consider each argument in turn.',\n",
       "  'Mid-American first argues that article 1.36 unreasonably restricts its access to the courts, and thus violates its rights of equal protection. See U.S. CONST. amend. XIV; TEX. CONST. art. I, § 3. We disagree. Article 1.36 serves the compelling state interest of ensuring that Texas citizens will have some means of recourse against unauthorized insurers. Thus, like the statute upheld in State Mutual, article 1.36 represents \"a reasonable exercise of the power of the state to protect the vital interests of its citizens.\" State Mutual, 353 S.W.2d at 419. See generally Blake v. McClung, 172 U.S. 239, 256, 19 S. Ct. 165, 172, 43 L. Ed. 432 (1898) (noting that State may require a non-resident to give a bond before suing in court, \"although such bond be not required of a resident\"); Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El Comandante, 535 F.2d 140, 144-45 (1st Cir.1976) (upholding requirement that nondomiciliary plaintiffs post security).',\n",
       "  'For similar reasons, article 1.36 is also consistent with the Open Courts provision of the Texas Constitution, TEX. CONST. art. 1, § 13. The statute does not impose the bond requirement blindly on all unauthorized insurers. An unauthorized insurer may be exempt from the minimum capital and surplus requirements for eligibility if the Commissioner of Insurance determines, after a public hearing, that an exemption is warranted, or that the insurer meets certain enumerated requirements. TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 8(c), (d). Even if the Commissioner does not make such a determination, the trial court may still dispense with the requirement of a bond upon a showing that the insurer maintains sufficient funds in the United States to satisfy a final judgment. TEX. INS.CODE art. 1.36, § 11(a)(1). Under these circumstances, we conclude that any infringement on Mid-American\\'s right of access to the courts is outweighed by the State\\'s interest in protecting policyholders. Cf.R Communications, Inc. v. Sharp, 875 S.W.2d 314, 317-18 (Tex.1994) (striking forfeiture provision on the ground that it served no state interest); Texas Ass\\'n of Business v.

Mid-American does not dispute, however, that it received notice and the full evidentiary hearing required by article 1.36. The provisions establishing this procedure were already in place at the time Mid-American issued a policy to Lopez-Gloria; the only significant change in the statute since that time was the 1993 addition of the exception in section 11(d). Given these circumstances, and the State's strong interest in protecting policyholders, we hold that article 1.36 does not violate Mid-American's right to due process or due course of law.\",\n",
       "  \"Finally, Mid-American argues that article 1.36 violates the separation of powers. See TEX. CONST. art. 2, § 1. Section 11 of article 1.36 vests a trial court with discretion to determine whether a bond should be required, and what the amount *328 of the bond should be. This discretion, Mid-American argues, places the trial court in a role that is more legislative than judicial. We disagree. Section 11 confers no more discretion on trial courts than they exercise in carrying out a number of other functions, such as setting court reporters' salaries. Texas courts have rejected arguments that the exercise of such discretion by trial courts necessarily violates the separation of powers. See, e.g., Holloway v. Butler, 828 S.W.2d 810, 811-12 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied); Pogue v. Duncan, 770 S.W.2d 867 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1989, writ denied).\",\n",

That definition is found in article 1.14-2, section 2(b), and is as follows: \"`Surplus lines insurer\\' means an unlicensed insurer deemed eligible pursuant to Section 8 of this Article in which an insurance coverage is placed or may be placed under this article.\" TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 2(b). Section 8 of article 1.14-2 sets out the requirements which must be met in order for a surplus lines insurer to qualify as an eligible insurer and includes the requirement that the insurer have a minimum capital and surplus of $15,000,000. TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 8(b).',\n",

       "  'The Court contends that the statute should be construed in this manner to give the broadest possible protection to Texas policyholders who have procured insurance from surplus lines insurers. At first blush, this is a compelling argument. I agree that the purpose of article 1.36 and other statutes regulating the insurance industry is to provide protection to the public and to insure a viable insurance industry. However, a recitation of these broad principles does not end the inquiry into the meaning of section 11(d). We must examine the specific language in the statute and apply well-settled principles of statutory construction.',\n",
       "  'The most troublesome aspect of the Court\\'s approach is that its construction of the statute gives little meaning to the Legislature\\'s specific use of \"the date applicable coverage was issued.\" TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.36, § 11(d). The Legislature clearly chose the date of the issuance of the policy as a pertinent point in time. In construing a statute, we must strive to give meaning to all of its provisions. Chevron Corp. v. Redmon, 745 S.W.2d 314, 316 (Tex.1987). If \"surplus lines insurers\" means \"eligible surplus lines insurers\" in section 11(d) of article 1.36, the Legislature could simply have limited the exemption to \"surplus lines insurers\" or to \"eligible surplus lines insurers.\" The additional requirement that the insurer was an \"eligible\" surplus lines insurer at the time the coverage was issued adds little substance to the statute.',\n",
       "  'The meaning of section 11(d) of article 1.36 is unmistakable when section 1.36 is considered in its entirety. The provisions of the Insurance Code which are at issue address several different categories of insurers, including domestic insurers that have been approved to operate in this state, foreign and alien insurance companies, unauthorized insurers, and surplus lines insurers. See, e.g., TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.36, § 3. There are different substantive provisions as well as procedural provisions applicable to each. Provisions which afford the fewest rights clearly apply to unauthorized insurers which have never become eligible to write insurance in this *330 state. The Court concludes that companies in the position of Mid-American, which were at one time eligible but who have been unable to meet the increased financial requirements, should be placed in the same category as wholly unauthorized insurers who have never met the eligibility requirements. The statute does not bear this out.',\n",

Section 3 provides a procedure for obtaining service of process on virtually all insurers: domestic approved insurers, foreign and alien companies, unauthorized insurers (which the Court recognizes would include Mid-American), and surplus lines insurers (which does not include Mid-American because it is no longer an eligible surplus lines insurer). Sections 7 and 8 provide additional procedures for obtaining service of process, but only on \"unauthorized insurers,\" through service on the commissioner of insurance in section 7 and on the secretary of state in section 8. Neither section 7 or section 8 is applicable to eligible surplus lines insurers. These sections only apply to unauthorized insurers. Eligible surplus lines insurers are not \"unauthorized insurers.\"[2]See TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-2, § 2(b). Yet, the same language which is at issue in section 11(d) of article 1.36 also appears in sections 7 and 8 of that article. Each of these sections states:',\n",

       "  'See TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.36, §§ 7(c) and 8(b). This language is entirely unnecessary if it means only eligible surplus lines insurers. They are not covered by either section 7 or 8 in any event. The Legislature obviously intended to carve out from sections 7(c) and 8(b), as well as 11(d), surplus lines insurers who were eligible at the time the policy was issued, but who could not meet the increased financial requirements.',\n",
       "  'In sections 7, 8, and 11 of article 1.36, the Legislature has drawn a distinction between surplus lines insurers who were eligible to write insurance in this state at the time the policy was issued and unauthorized insurers which never met the eligibility requirements at any point in time.',\n",
       "  'The Court concludes that if eligibility were not required at the time the policy issued and at the present, the state would be encouraging ineligible insurers to issue policies and to postpone meeting eligibility requirements. This reasoning does not withstand scrutiny. It is highly unlikely that imposing a bond requirement in litigation would offer any kind of \"incentive\" for companies to meet to the capital and surplus requirements. Either they have the financial wherewithal, or they do not. It is also doubtful that requiring a bond after litigation ensues over a policy provides any disincentive to a company who has already violated the law by writing unlawful coverage. A person or insurer who conducts unauthorized insurance business is subject to civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation and for each day of violation, and may be enjoined from continuing the violation or threat of violation. TEX.INS.CODE art. 1.14-1, §§ 3(d) & (e).',\n",
       "  'The Court infers that because Mid-American no longer meets the financial requirements under article 1.14-2 and therefore is no longer an eligible surplus lines insurer, that it must be teetering on the edge of insolvency, and that the bond or other security requirements in article 1.36 were viewed as necessary by the Legislature to protect policyholders. Such an inference does not automatically flow in light of the history of section 1.14-2 of the Insurance Code. Prior to 1987, *331 there were general requirements set out in section 1.14-2 for \"eligible\" surplus lines insurers. In 1987, that section was amended, and for the first time, it included specific capital and surplus requirements which increased over time. Under the statute, the capital and surplus requirement for surplus lines insurers was $2,500,000 in 1987, gradually increasing over the years to $3,500,000, then $4,500,000, and up to $6,000,000 on and after December 31, 1992. The 1993 amendments implemented a further, very substantial increase to $15,000,000. The fact that Mid-American does not meet the $15,000,000 threshold does not mean that in the judgment of the Legislature, companies in its position border on insolvency and should be required to post a bond before they are permitted to defend themselves in the courts of this state.',\n",

The purpose of a water quality protection zone is to \"provide the flexibility necessary to facilitate the development of the land within the zone, but which also is intended to result in the protection of the quality of water within the zone.\" TEX.

The City and the defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court rendered a final judgment declaring section 26.179 unconstitutional, without specifying the grounds for its judgment, and permanently enjoined the Landowners from designating new zones or adding land to existing zones.

See, e.g., Barber, The Constitution and Delegation of Congressional Power 38 (1975); Jaffe, Law Making by Private Groups, 51 Harv. L.Rev. 201, 248 (1937). Generally, commentators have defined legislative power as the power to make rules and determine public policy. See Barber, supra, at 38 (defining legislative power as \"deciding between conflicting proposals presented by clashing interests\"); Schoenbrod, Power Without Responsibility: How Congress Abuses the People Through Delegation 181 (1993) (\"The essence of ... legislative power is the making of laws of private conduct.\"). In Texas, legislative power is defined broadly. It includes the power to set public policy. See, e.g., Chemical Bank & Trust Co. v. Falkner, 369 S.W.2d 427, 432 (Tex.1963); Davis v. City of Lubbock, 160 Tex. 38, 326 S.W.2d 699, 713 (1959). In addition, it includes many functions that have administrative aspects, including the power to provide the details of the law, to promulgate rules and regulations to apply the law, and to ascertain conditions upon which existing laws may operate. See Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Found., Inc. v. Lewellen, 952 S.W.2d 454, 466-67 (Tex.1997); see also Housing Auth. of Dallas v. Higginbotham, 135 Tex. 158, 143 S.W.2d 79, 87 (1940) (providing categories of delegations to public entities, including delegations to make rules to implement statutes, to find facts and ascertain conditions upon which an existing law may operate, to fix rates, and to determine the question of necessity of taking land for public use). Because this definition of delegation sweeps so broadly, it is not surprising that \"the debate over unconstitutional delegation becomes a debate not over a point of principle but over a question of degree.\" Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 466 (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 415, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).',\n",
       "  'Although the Constitution vests legislative power in the Legislature, courts have recognized that in a complex society like ours, delegation of legislative power is both necessary and proper in certain circumstances. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 466. Thus, the Legislature may delegate legislative power to local governments, administrative agencies, and even private entities under certain conditions. See Proctor, 972 S.W.2d at 734-35. The Legislature may delegate powers to agencies established to carry out legislative purposes as long as the Legislature establishes reasonable standards to guide the agency in exercising those powers. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 467; see also Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Meno, 917 S.W.2d 717, 740 (Tex.1995) (upholding a delegation to the Commissioner of Education to adopt rules \"necessary for the implementation of Chapter 36 of the Education Code); Higginbotham, 143 S.W.2d at 81, 83, 86 (upholding a statute giving a housing authority the power to, among *874 other things, condemn property and to select housing for tenants).',\n",
       "  'But because delegations to private entities raise more troubling constitutional issues than public delegations, they are subject to more stringent requirements and less judicial deference than public delegations. See Proctor, 972 S.W.2d at 735; Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 469-70. Legislative delegations to private entities can compromise \"the basic concept of democratic rule under a republican form of government\" because private delegates are not elected by the people, appointed by a public official or entity, or employed by the government. Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 469. And, on a more practical basis, private delegations may allow private interests to adversely affect the public interest. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 469.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, as we explained in Boll Weevil, private delegations are frequently necessary and desirable. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 469. Indeed, private delegations are used extensively in Texas government. The Legislature has routinely delegated to private associations the power to promulgate certain industrial and professional standards. See, e.g., TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 441.007(b) (requiring graduation from a privately accredited library school for permanent certification as county librarian); Tex. Health & Safety Code § 142.006 (allowing the Department of Health to issue licenses to privately accredited homes and community support services agencies); TEX. OCC.CODE § 204.153 (defining physician assistant as person who graduated from a program accredited by the American Medical Association\\'s Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation and who has passed the certifying examination administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants); see also Proctor, 972 S.W.2d at 738 (upholding a delegation to two private entities, the American Arbitration Association and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, to decide whether a hearing examiner was \"a qualified neutral arbitrator\" to hear civil service appeals); Dudding v.

For example, Boll Weevil\\'s constitutional analysis properly focused heavily on the first factor\\x97whether there was meaningful governmental review of the delegates\\' actions. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 473-74. Because one of the central concerns in private delegations is the potential compromise of our \"democratic rule under a republican form of government,\" weighing the first factor heavily is appropriate whenever a statute delegates legislative power to private interested parties. Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 469. Because the other central concern is the potential that the delegate may have a \"personal or pecuniary interest inconsistent with or repugnant to the public interest to be served,\" another factor that weighs heavily in these kinds of delegations is, of course, the fourth factor\\x97 whether the private delegate has a pecuniary or other personal interest that may conflict with its public function.

WATER CODE § 26.179(d); 21 Tex. Reg. 11597 (1996). Section 26.179 allows landowners to choose between two general objectives in formulating their water quality plans: (1) to maintain background levels of water quality in waterways; or (2) to capture and retain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(a). But landowners owning 1,000 acres or more, at least initially, decide how to achieve these objectives in their water quality plans. While landowners owning 500 to 1,000 acres must secure pre-approval of their water quality zones from the TNRCC, landowners owning 1,000 acres or more can designate a zone and implement a water quality plan without pre-approval from the TNRCC. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(e), (f). Only after these plans are in effect does the TNRCC have review power. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). And if the TNRCC denies a plan and the landowner appeals that decision in court, the plan remains in effect throughout the appeal process. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). Further, for zones of all sizes, the TNRCC has the burden of proof on the denial of a plan or amendment to a plan. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g).',\n",

See County of Fairfax, 410 S.E.2d at 670. The court noted that the county was powerless to enact zoning regulations even if it reasonably determined that the regulations were necessary for the public welfare. See County of Fairfax, 410 S.E.2d at 673. Similarly, in Brodner, the court held that a city ordinance that required an owner's consent before a city could rezone his property was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. See Brodner, 51 Ill. Dec. 618, 420 N.E.2d at 1178. The court noted that, although the city may be effecting a comprehensive zoning plan in pursuit of the common good, the owner had the absolute discretion to decide that no rezoning shall ever occur and could selfishly and arbitrarily frustrate the City's plan. See Brodner, 51 Ill. Dec. 618, 420 N.E.2d at 1178.

In developing and implementing a water quality plan, the landowners are exercising authority over water quality, a public interest. In exempting themselves from the enforcement of their choice of municipal regulations, they may affect the public interest on whose behalf those regulations were enacted. Yet, the landowners are not elected by the people, appointed by a public official or entity, or employed by the government. And, their pecuniary interest in developing their land to realize profit may be inconsistent with or repugnant to the public interest.

       "  'B. THE DISSENTING OPINIONS',\n",
       "  'Most of Justice Owen\\'s dissent is nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric, and thus merits no response. We note only that the two legal arguments Justice Owen does make are both based on a flawed premise. First, she argues that section 26.179 is not a delegation because, in enacting the statute, the Legislature merely took back the regulatory power that the Legislature itself gave to municipalities. *878 Second, she argues that section 26.179 cannot be a delegation because it merely restores private property rights to landowners. But section 26.179 does not just deregulate. Instead, as we have explained, the statute gives private landowners public duties and regulatory power to achieve those duties. Just because the Legislature could have deregulated property in ETJs or regulated property in ETJs itself does not mean that giving these duties and powers to the landowners cannot be a delegation. On the contrary, this is the definition of a legislative delegation. Again, legislative power includes the power to provide the details of the law, to promulgate rules and regulations to apply the law, and to ascertain conditions upon which existing laws may operate. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 466-67; Higginbotham, 143 S.W.2d at 87. When the Legislature gave these powers to the landowners with the obligation to protect water quality, it delegated legislative power to them. To the extent that Justice Owen\\'s dissent makes additional legal arguments, these arguments mirror Justice Abbott\\'s and we consider them in our response to Justice Abbott\\'s dissent. Interestingly, part I of Justice Abbott\\'s dissent relies heavily on the dissent he joined in Boll Weevil. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 491 (Cornyn, J., concurring and dissenting). First, Justice Abbott claims that the sky is falling because of our holding that section 26.179 is unconstitutional. 22 S.W.3d at 898-99; see Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 491-92 (Cornyn, J., concurring and dissenting). But this case is not about school vouchers, private prisons, or even private property rights. Cf. Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 473 (\"[W]e express no opinion as to whether any of the other statutory enactments cited by the dissenting justices would or would not pass constitutional muster. Thus, in no way does our opinion, as the dissenting justices fear, `ultimately threaten the heretofore established role of quasi-governmental entities under Texas law.\\'\"). The issue in this case is whether section 26.179 of the Water Code is a constitutional delegation.',\n",
       "  \"Next, as the dissent in Boll Weevil argued, Justice Abbott argues that we have improperly applied the standard of review for facial challenges. 22 S.W.3d at 900; Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 492 (Cornyn, J., concurring and dissenting). Again, we reject this argument here for the same reasons we rejected it in Boll Weevil. Because we are reviewing the statute under a facial challenge, section 26.179's constitutionality depends on whether the statute as written, rather than as it operates in practice, passes the Boll Weevil factors. See Proctor, 972 S.W.2d at 735; Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 472-74. Further, our analysis of the statute's constitutionality does not rely on individual outcomes or individual steps in the governmental review process, but on the statutory scheme as a whole. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 473. Thus, the fact that the TNRCC actually denied two water quality plans does not render the statute constitutional. Because the overall statutory scheme is itself unconstitutional, the statute always operates unconstitutionally, regardless of whether the TNRCC approves or denies a particular plan. Indeed, as we explain in our discussion of the Boll Weevil factors, despite the TNRCC's power to deny water quality plans, there is no meaningful governmental review of the landowners' actions, there is inadequate representation of those affected by the landowners' actions, the landowners have pecuniary interests that may conflict with their public function, and the delegation is broad in duration and extent. In sum, that the application of an unconstitutional statute can, in some cases, reach the same result as the application of a constitutional statute does not make the unconstitutional statute constitutional.\",\n",
       "  \"Before we consider the constitutionality of the delegation in depth, we respond to Justice Abbott's claim that there is no delegation at all. First, Justice Abbott argues that section 26.179 does not delegate *879 legislative power because it merely allows landowners to opt out of municipal regulations and into section 26.179's water quality protection scheme. On the contrary, section 26.179 does more than that. Section 26.179 does not simply allow landowners to choose between two distinct regulatory schemes. Unlike the statutes in the cases the dissent cites, section 26.179 allows the landowners to create part of the regulatory scheme that they choose. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g); cf. Helvering v. Lerner Stores Corp., 314 U.S. 463, 468, 62 S. Ct. 341, 86 L. Ed. 482 (1941) (statute allowing taxpayers to choose between distinct and predefined tax bases); Thomas Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, 242 U.S. 526, 531, 37 S. Ct. 190, 61 L. Ed. 472 (1917) (statute allowing adjoining landowners to waive a zoning prohibition against billboards on their neighbor's property).\",\n",
       "  \"The landowners create a water quality and land use plan, thereby exempting themselves from the enforcement of municipal regulations that are inconsistent with or inconvenient to those plans, and thus cannot be enforced on their property. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(i). Therefore, although the landowners are not given the power to directly suspend municipal laws, the landowners do ascertain conditions upon which those laws will be enforced. Again, this is a legislative power. See Higginbotham, 143 S.W.2d at 87. Justice Abbott argues that the Legislature could not have practically specified which municipal powers would be inconsistent with water quality or land use plans. This may be true. But he misses the point. The landowners have the power to create those inconsistencies simply by drawing up plans that do not comply with municipal regulations. For the same reason, Justice Abbott's argument that there is no delegation because the courts will ultimately decide disputes about whether a particular municipal regulation can be enforced in a zone is equally misguided. The only issue a court could review in such a dispute is whether the regulation at issue is in fact inconsistent with the landowner's plans and therefore cannot be enforced. Further, that a court can ultimately decide disputes about the exercise of a delegated power cannot mean, as the dissent argues, that there is no delegation. Courts routinely review delegates' decisions. See, e.g., Quick, 7 S.W.3d at 119 (holding that a city ordinance was not invalid, arbitrary, unreasonable, inefficient, or ineffective in its attempt to control water quality); TEX. GOV'T CODE § 2001.171 (providing judicial review of state agency decisions).\",\n",
       "  \"Justice Abbott also argues that, unlike the delegation in Boll Weevil, the landowners do not have authoritative power over the private property of others. Cf. Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 471. We agree. But we disagree that this means that there is no delegation of legislative power here. In Boll Weevil, the statute at issue provided for the creation of a private foundation that, subject to referendum approval from affected cotton growers, operated boll weevil eradication programs and assessed cotton growers for the programs' costs. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 456-57. The foundation could impose penalties upon growers for the late payment of assessments and could enter private property without the owner's permission for any purpose under the statute, including the monitoring, treatment and destruction of crops. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 457-58.\",\n",
       "  \"Here, the landowners regulate water quality and decide which municipal regulations are enforceable only on their own property and the property of their successors in interests. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(d), (h). Nevertheless, the landowners' powers over water quality protection and their power to exempt themselves from the enforcement of municipal ordinances could adversely affect the public interest, and more specifically, the interests of downstream water users and the landowners' neighbors. Therefore, the landowners, like the foundation in Boll Weevil, are charged with legislative duties *880 and powers, the exercise of which could affect the public interest and specific third parties.\",\n",
       "  'Next, Justice Abbott contends that classifying section 26.179 as a delegation renders every statute that allows private citizens discretion in meeting a statutory standard a delegation. We disagree. A delegation occurs only when an entity is given a public duty and the discretion to set public policy, promulgate rules to achieve that policy, or ascertain conditions upon which existing laws will apply. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 466-67; Higginbotham, 143 S.W.2d at 87. By entrusting private landowners with authority over water quality protection and other regulations on their property, section 26.179 entrusts them with public duties and gives them broad discretion to decide whether, how, and to what extent to achieve those duties.',\n",
       "  \"The remainder of the Justice Abbott's argument about why section 26.179 is not a delegation relies heavily on the TNRCC's role in reviewing water quality plans and in regulating water quality in general and implies that because section 26.179 delegates power to the TNRCC, it does not delegate power to the landowners. But, as we explained in Boll Weevil, when a statute delegates authoritative power to private interested parties, it is a private delegation. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 471. That the delegation is in conjunction with a delegation to a public entity, or that the government reviews the delegate's actions may be relevant in assessing the constitutionality of the delegation, but it does not mean that it is not a private delegation.

       "  \"Section 26.179 vests the TNRCC with only limited review over the landowners' water quality protection plans and their effectiveness in protecting water quality. Further, neither the TNRCC nor any other governmental agency has the power to review the landowners' decisions about which municipal regulations will be enforceable on their property.\",\n",
       "  \"First, we agree with the Landowners and the dissent that under section 26.179, landowners remain subject to pre-existing state water quality regulations, future state water quality regulations necessary to comply with federal standards, and the TNRCC's powers to enforce those regulations. Zones implementing water quality plans that meet section 26.179's requirements are presumed to satisfy all other state and local requirements for water quality protection. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(k). Nevertheless, section 26.179 requires that development in the zones comply with all state laws and TNRCC rules regulating water quality which are in effect on the zone designation date. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(k)(1). These may include existing permitting, licensing, and spill response programs designed to prevent pollution from storage, transportation, and disposal of waste, hazardous substances, and wastewater. See 21 Tex. Reg. 11601 (1996). Specifically, TNRCC regulations related to the Edwards Aquifer, on-site wastewater treatment, water well drilling, sewerage systems, underground and aboveground storage tanks, effluent limitations, and watershed protection may apply to the zones. See 21 Tex. Reg. 11601-02 (1996). Further, subsection *881 26.179(m) provides that the TNRCC may require and enforce additional water quality protection measures to comply with mandatory federal water quality requirements. See Tex. Water Code § 26.179(m).\",\n",
       "  \"But section 26.179 curbs the TNRCC's review and enforcement powers over section 26.179's requirements and the landowners' discretion in meeting them in several important ways. Section 26.179 requires the TNRCC to review water quality plans and their effectiveness in achieving section 26.179's objectives of maintaining background levels of water quality or retaining 1.5 inches of rainfall. Landowners owning 500 to 1,000 acres must secure pre-approval of their zone designations from the TNRCC before their zone designations are recorded in the county deed records and become effective. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(d). Zone designations include a water quality plan for the zone, a description of proposed water quality facilities and infrastructure, and a general description of proposed land uses for the zone. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(e). Although the statute is not explicit about the scope of the TNRCC's review, the TNRCC has reasonably interpreted the pre-approval provision to require that the TNRCC approve water quality plans and amendments before they become effective in zones of 500 to 1,000 acres. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(d), (e), (g); see also 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 216.3(a). Therefore, the TNRCC cannot disapprove a zone designation for any other reason other than the failure of the zone's water quality plan to meet section 26.179's requirements.\",\n",
       "  'Landowners with 1,000 acres or more need not seek TNRCC approval until after their water quality plans or amendments are already in effect. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). Section 26.179(g) provides that, for these larger zones, water quality plans need not be submitted to the TNRCC until after they are recorded in county deed records. See Tex. Water Code § 26.179(g). Subsection (g) further provides that water quality plans and amendments to plans are effective immediately upon recordation and apply during TNRCC review and even during an appeal of a TNRCC denial of the plan or amendment. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). Thus, landowners owning 1,000 acres or more can begin to develop land and implement water quality plans even before the TNRCC begins its review. See 21 Tex. Reg. 11607 (1996) (\"[C]onstruction is allowed by provisions of the statute ... upon proper designation of the zone and submittal of the water quality plan for the zone to the executive director for review.\").',\n",
       "  'This is contrary to the rule in similar regulatory schemes. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.027(c) (\"A person may not commence construction of a [water] treatment facility until the commission has issued a permit.\"); TEX. WATER CODE § 11.121 (\"Except as provided in ... this code, no person may ... begin construction of any work designed for the storage, taking, or diversion of water without first obtaining a permit from the commission.\"); 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 213.2 (\"[T]he owner of an existing or proposed site, such as a residential or commercial development, ... who proposes new or additional regulated activities under this chapter, must file for and receive [TNRCC] executive director approval of all appropriate applications prior to commencement of construction of new or additional regulated activities\"); 30 TEX. ADMIN.

       "  \"The TNRCC must approve a plan or amendment to a plan unless the TNRCC finds that implementing it will not reasonably maintain background levels of water quality or capture and retain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). The statute is silent about the effect of a TNRCC denial of a plan or *882 amendment. The TNRCC, however, has reasonably interpreted the statute to provide that a denied water quality plan is no longer effective unless the landowner appeals the denial. See 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 216.3(e)(6), 216.4(1). The statute allows a landowner to appeal the TNRCC's denial of a plan or amendment to the courts, and, contrary to the general rule for judicial review of agency decisions, the denied plan or amendment is effective and applies to the zone during the appellate process. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g); cf. § 26.177(d) (the TNRCC's ruling on city water pollution abatement regulation remains in effect for all purposes during appeal of the ruling). Although the statute does not expressly limit this particular provision's application to landowners with 1,000 acres or more, we interpret this provision to apply only to these larger landowners and not to landowners with 500 to 1,000 acres. This is because the latter group's plans and amendments are not effective until the TNRCC approves them and therefore cannot apply to development in the zone during the appeal of a TNRCC denial. Also atypical of review procedures, for both small and large zones, the TNRCC has the burden of proof on appeal. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g); cf. City of San Antonio v. Texas Water Comm'n, 407 S.W.2d 752, 758 (Tex.1966) (the party appealing the TNRCC's order has the burden to show that the evidence does not reasonably support the order).\",\n",
       "  'Once the TNRCC approves a plan, the statute requires landowners purporting to maintain background levels of water quality to monitor water quality. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). But monitoring is not required until after each phase of development is completed, and then, monitoring is only required for three years. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). Further, there is no requirement that development occur in phases. Therefore, monitoring might not be required until a zone is completely developed, which could take years. During the three-year monitoring period, the landowner must summarize the monitoring results, describe the best management practices being used in the zone, and annually submit them to the TNRCC in a technical report for review. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). If the reports reveal that background levels were not maintained during the previous year, the landowner must modify the water quality plan but only for future development phases in the zone and only to the extent reasonably feasible and practical. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b)(1). The statute requires modification of operational and maintenance practices in existing phases, but again, only to the extent reasonably feasible and practical. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b)(2).',\n",
       "  \"The TNRCC reviews the landowners' modifications and determines whether they modify plans and practices to the extent required under the statute, that is, to the extent reasonably feasible and practical. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g) (providing that the TNRCC reviews all amendments to water quality plans). But as is true for TNRCC review of initial water quality plans, for landowners owning 1,000 acres or more, modifications and amendments to plans are effective immediately upon recordation and remain effective during TNRCC review and an appeal of a TNRCC denial. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). Further, for zones of all sizes, the TNRCC has the burden of proof on appeal of a denial of a modification. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g).\",\n",
       "  \"Therefore, regardless of the modifications actually necessary to achieve section 26.179's objectives, any modification is required only to the extent it is reasonably feasible and practical. Further, plan modifications are only required for future phases of development in the zone. It follows that if the landowner does not develop in phases, the landowner need not modify even a grossly insufficient water quality plan, because there are no future phases for which the statute requires plan *883 modification. See 21 Tex. Reg. 11611 (1996). Further, because monitoring is required only after development is complete, or after a phase of development, if any, is complete, extensive modifications of existing operational and maintenance practices, even if needed to achieve section 26.179's water quality objectives, may not be reasonably feasible and practical, and consequently not required. And, as development continues in zones of 1,000 acres or more during TNRCC review of modifications, necessary modifications likely become less feasible and practical.\",\n",
       "  'The TNRCC has even less enforcement power in zones purporting to retain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas. The statute states that, for these zones, \"[w]ater quality monitoring shall not be required.\" TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). Moreover, all of the statute\\'s language about monitoring and submitting annual reports falls under the first paragraph in subsection 26.179(b), which expressly refers to zones maintaining background water quality levels. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). Nevertheless, the TNRCC has promulgated rules requiring zones retaining rainfall to maintain certain records and submit them, along with an assessment of the water quality plan\\'s success in meeting the TNRCC\\'s water quality requirements. See 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 216.8(a)(2), (a)(3), (b). To the extent the TNRCC\\'s rules require monitoring of water quality in these zones, they are contrary to the statute\\'s plain language prohibiting the TNRCC from requiring such monitoring. Indeed, the Landowners\\' comments to proposed TNRCC rules note that the TNRCC\\'s reporting requirements for zones retaining rainfall were \"excessive and unnecessary.\" 21 Tex. Reg. 11613 (1996). Although we defer to administrative interpretations of legislation, we do so only when they are reasonable interpretations. See TEX. GOV\\'T CODE § 311.023(6); Public Util. Comm\\'n, 883 S.W.2d at 196. Contrary to the TNRCC\\'s interpretation, the statute\\'s plain language prohibits the TNRCC from monitoring or requiring monitoring of water quality in these zones. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). Not surprisingly, all but one of the zones filed with the TNRCC elected to retain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas instead of maintaining background levels of water quality. See 21 Tex. Reg. 11605 (1996).',\n",
       "  'Finally, the TNRCC has very limited power over the decision to designate a zone. The TNRCC does have pre-approval power over zone designations of 500 to 1,000 acres. But the statute does not allow the TNRCC to de-designate any zone for noncompliance with section 26.179 or other applicable regulations. Similarly, in Boll Weevil, although the Commissioner of Agriculture could dissolve the foundation once the Commissioner determined the foundation had fulfilled its eradication purpose or had become inoperative or abandoned, the Commissioner had no power to dissolve the foundation for noncompliance with applicable statutory requirements. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 473. This fact weighed heavily against the delegation. See Boll Weevil, 952 S.W.2d at 473. Here, the TNRCC has no authority whatsoever to dissolve or de-designate a zone for noncompliance with section 26.179 or other water quality protection laws and regulations. This fact similarly weighs against the delegation here.',\n",
       "  \"We conclude that, while the landowners' powers under section 26.179 are subject to some TNRCC review, the review is not meaningful as the first factor requires. Instead, the statute allows a landowner with 1,000 acres or more to develop before TNRCC approval and during the appeal of a TNRCC denial. Further, it allows landowners of zones of all sizes to lock into an insufficient water quality protection plan by developing under the plan before any monitoring for the plan's effectiveness in protecting water quality is required. And, as development continues in larger zones during TNRCC review and the appellate *884 process, necessary modifications become less and less feasible and practical, and are therefore less likely to be required.\",\n",
       "  'While the landowners\\' water quality plans are subject to some TNRCC review, the landowners\\' authority to decide which municipal regulations can be enforced on their property is not subject to any TNRCC review. By designating a zone, a landowner exempts himself from the enforcement of municipal ordinances relating to land use, nuisance abatement, pollution control, water quality, subdivision requirements, and any other municipal environmental regulation that is \"inconsistent with the land use plan and the water quality plan or which in any way limit, modify, or impair the ability to implement and operate the water quality plan and the land use plan within the zone as filed.\" TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(i). While section 26.179 does provide some TNRCC oversight of water quality protection plans, it does not give the TNRCC or any other governmental agency the authority to review the landowners\\' power to exempt themselves from the enforcement of their choice of city regulations and powers. Of course, courts could eventually decide disputes about whether certain municipal ordinances are inconsistent with water quality and land use plans. But, as discussed earlier, the landowner makes the initial decision about which municipal regulations can be enforced on its property without any governmental oversight.',\n",

       "  \"As discussed previously, the landowners' actions in creating and implementing water quality plans could adversely affect neighbors, downstream water users, and the public generally. The statute requires that the landowners give notice of zone designations to the municipality within whose ETJ a zone is located and the county in which the property is located. See Tex. Water Code § 26.179(f). But section 26.179 prohibits the TNRCC from requiring a public hearing on a water quality plan. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). This is contrary to the TNRCC's general power to hold public hearings on the administration of chapter 26 of the Water Code, and the TNRCC's duty to hold public hearings on the TNRCC's water quality standards, on discharge permit applications, and on orders regulating the Edwards Aquifer. See TEX. WATER CODE §§ 26.020, .024, .028, .029, .046.\",\n",
       "  'The statute expressly provides landowners the right to appeal TNRCC denial of a water quality plan to a court of competent jurisdiction. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). But the statute does not confer any party the right to appeal TNRCC approval of a plan or zone designation. Section 5.351 of the Water Code generally allows affected persons to seek a court order setting aside, modifying or suspending a ruling, order, decision, or other act of the TNRCC. See TEX. WATER CODE § 5.351(a). Nevertheless, a plain reading of section 26.179 leads us to conclude that the Legislature did not intend to confer a right to appeal any act under section 26.179 except TNRCC denial of a plan. That section 26.179(g) expressly confers a right to appeal the denial of a plan but is devoid of similar language allowing an appeal of a plan, its approval, or zone designation is significant. See Cameron v. Terrell & Garrett, Inc., 618 S.W.2d 535, 540 (Tex.1981) (holding that every word or phrase excluded from a statute must be presumed to have been excluded for a purpose). This is especially true given the language of section 26.177(d), which expressly confers a right to appeal to \"[a]ny person affected by any ruling, order, decision, ordinance, program, resolution, or other act of a city relating to water pollution *885 control and abatement.\" Tex. Water Code § 26.177(d). Section 26.177(d) shows that the Legislature knows how to provide a right of appeal to persons affected by a water quality plan or government action relating to a plan. Yet, the Legislature chose not to provide such a right to persons affected by section 26.179 plans or TNRCC approval of plans.',\n",
       "  \"In addition, the landowners alone decide which municipal regulations cannot be enforced in their zones. The statute requires that landowners give applicable counties and municipalities notice of their zone designations, which includes a description of proposed land uses and a water quality plan. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(e), (f). This provides constructive notice of the land use and water quality plans to affected members of the public. But the statute does not require the landowners to notify anyone, including neighboring property owners or downstream water users, about the municipal regulations that cannot be enforced on their property because they interfere with the land use or water quality plan. And, although affected persons retain their common law causes of action, the statute does not provide any right of review of the landowners' decisions about their land use or water quality plans to affected individuals or to the municipality.\",\n",

The Landowners concede that those who designate their property as a zone have an interest in protecting their property values. The Landowners argue, though, that they do not have a public function. As we have already explained, section 26.179 allows landowners to regulate water quality and to decide which municipal regulations cannot be enforced on their property.

The statute delegates to private landowners the power to govern water quality and land use only on their own property and that of their successors in interest. And, the landowners are still subject to existing state and TNRCC water quality regulations and additional regulations necessary to comply with federal standards.\",\n",
       "  \"But the extent of the delegation is fairly broad. Landowners have the power to create, implement, and enforce their own water quality plans. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b), (d), (f), (g). These plans could adversely affect the public interest and the interests of neighbors and downstream water users. Yet, these plans apply to development in zones with 1,000 acres or more before TNRCC approval, and even after a TNRCC denial if the landowners appeal the denial. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). Further, for those plans for which water quality monitoring is required, even if monitoring reveals that the plans are not achieving section 26.179's objectives, the plans need not be modified except in future phases of development, if any. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). Modifications are required only to the extent reasonably feasible and practical. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). Therefore, as we noted in our discussion of the first factor, the landowners have broad discretion in actually complying with section 26.179's water quality objectives. Landowners also have the power to exempt their property from the enforcement of any city regulations that are inconsistent with their water quality plan and land use plan or that could limit, modify, or impair the landowners' ability to implement those plans for the property. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(i).\",\n",
       "  'The delegation to the landowners is not narrow in duration either. The statute expressly provides that the water quality plan is a covenant running with the land. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(h). A zone and the coordinate power to regulate water quality and exempt property from municipal laws exists until a city annexes the zone. See Tex. Water Code § 26.179(i). And section 26.179 prohibits annexation until 20 years after zone designation or until 90 percent of the zone\\'s facilities and infrastructure are complete, whichever occurs first. See Tex. Water Code § 26.179(i). Thus, under the statute, if a city does not annex under subsection (i), the zone and the landowners\\' powers in the zone last indefinitely. This is contrary to the time limits found in other regulatory schemes. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.029 (\"In each permit, the commission shall prescribe the conditions on which it is issued, including the duration of the permit.\"); 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 213.4(h) (\"[A]pproval of an Edwards Aquifer protection plan will expire two years after the date of initial issuance, unless prior to the expiration date, substantial construction related to the approved plan has commenced.\").

Therefore, ordinarily, this factor would weigh against the delegation. Nevertheless, the statute does require landowners to hire registered professional engineers to review their water quality plans and amendments. Accordingly, although the statute does not require the delegate to have relevant qualifications or training, it requires the delegate to hire a professional who does. Because *887 engineers have a professional obligation beyond their employers' self-interest, requiring their review makes it more likely that landowners will achieve section 26.179's water quality objectives than would requiring the landowners themselves to have engineering expertise.\",\n",

Further, in zones purporting to maintain background levels of water quality, if data on background levels are unavailable, an engineer must calculate and certify the background levels to maintain. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(b). And, a professional engineer must acknowledge that the landowner's subdivision plat complies with the water quality plan. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(j)(2).

There is no time limit for submitting proposed modifications to the TNRCC, and for landowners with 1,000 acres or more, the modifications apply to zone activities during TNRCC review and even during the appeal of a TNRCC denial of a modification. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(g). Further, as more development occurs, needed modifications become less feasible and practical.

Moreover, in Proctor, the authority delegated was narrow\\x97to forward names of potential arbitrators for selection. The criteria \"qualified\" and \"neutral\" were well-suited for this narrow purpose.

       "  'I strongly dissent from what the Court has wrought today. The importance of this case to private property rights and to the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches of government cannot be overstated. The Legislature is forbidden by the Texas Constitution, the Court says, from allowing property owners to make decisions about how they use and develop their own land. While the Constitution certainly permits the Legislature to enact laws that preserve and conserve the State\\'s natural resources, there is nothing in the Constitution that requires the Legislature to exercise that power in any particular manner. How the Legislature chooses to regulate is left to the Legislature, not this Court. Our Constitution plainly states that in preserving and conserving our natural resources, \"the Legislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.\" TEX. CONST. art. XVI, § 59(a). Instead of seeking to uphold the laws that the Legislature has passed toward that end, the Court has seized upon the rarely used nondelegation doctrine to claim constitutional authority for an unprecedented restriction of the Legislature\\'s power and an equally unprecedented restriction on private property rights.',\n",
       "  \"*889 The Court's holding today raises profoundly disturbing questions. Does the way in which the Legislature regulates water quality on private property in rural areas unconstitutionally delegate legislative powers to private property owners? Does the Legislature's regulation of water quality in suburban areas that are outside a city's extraterritorial jurisdiction amount to an unconstitutional delegation? The answer to these questions should be no, and when the Court's opinion is examined with that in mind, the dearth of logic in the Court's decision is apparent.\",\n",
       "  \"I am at a loss to understand what is driving the Court's opinion, since it clearly is not reasoned decision-making. I know only that the Court today exercises raw power to override the will of the Legislature and of the people of Texas. The Court strikes a severe blow to private property rights and usurps authority that is reserved to another branch of government\\x97the Legislature. If the Court has any intention of applying the holdings in this case to future cases, the Court will impair all manner of property rights, and hamstring the Legislature's ability to function as the Texas Constitution and the people of Texas intend that it should.\",\n",
       "  \"This case should have been resolved by applying two straightforward principles of law. The first is that it is not an unconstitutional delegation to restore to private landowners in a city's extraterritorial jurisdiction property rights that other landowners across the state enjoy. The second is that the City of Austin had authority to regulate within its ETJ only because the Legislature granted it that authority. What the Legislature grants, it may take away from its own subdivisions.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'I',\n",
       "  'The Water Code provisions at issue apply to the ETJs of certain cities.[1] The Court spends a considerable amount of time characterizing these provisions. I include them in Appendix A so that readers can see for themselves what the Code provisions say.',\n",
       "  \"The Court does not and cannot dispute that the Legislature's purpose in promulgating these statutes was to balance several considerations, chief among them being the need to maintain water quality and the desire not to unduly hinder economic development in this State. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.003.[2] The Legislature enacted section 26.179 of the Water Code because it concluded that at least one city, namely Austin, had abused the authority the Legislature had given it under section 26.177[3] to regulate water pollution within its ETJ, and that other cities could do the same. By passing section 26.179,[4] the Legislature restored to landowners some of the freedom from regulation that they enjoyed before their land was engulfed by a city's ETJ.\",\n",
       "  \"Briefly summarized, the Legislature gave large landowners within certain cities' ETJs an election. Owners of at least 500 contiguous acres of land in those ETJs could decide either to continue to abide by the city's water quality ordinances adopted under section 26.177, or meet one of two different state-mandated water quality standards under section 26.179. The first state-granted option was to maintain background levels of water quality in waterways, and the second was to capture and retain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas. See id. § 26.179(a). Section 26.179 and regulations promulgated under it by the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission set forth specific directions as to how these water quality levels were to be achieved *890 and verified. See id.; 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 216.1-.11. (1996).\",\n",
       "  \"The Court concedes, as it must, that in addition to the requirements of section 26.179, landowners are required to meet all other then-existing state water quality regulations as well as all future regulations necessary to comply with federal standards, and that landowners are subject to the TNRCC's power to enforce those regulations. See 22 S.W.3d at 880. Thus, landowners within an affected city's ETJ are subject to more state regulation than are landowners just a few feet outside an ETJ and rural landowners all across Texas.\",\n",
       "  \"The question, then, concerning landowners within and outside cities' ETJs is whether the State's scheme of regulating water quality amounts to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. I turn to that question.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'II',\n",
       "  \"The Court's opinion focuses extensively on the types of city ordinances that would no longer apply within an ETJ if a landowner elected to create a water quality protection zone and to comply with State as opposed to city water quality standards. See, e.g., 22 S.W.3d at 875. Under section 26.179(i), the Legislature prohibited a city from acting within its ETJ to abate nuisances, control pollution, or enforce any environmental regulations that were inconsistent with a land use and water quality plan filed by a landowner in connection with a water quality protection zone. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(i). And the Legislature prohibited a city from annexing land in such a zone until the earlier of twenty years from the date the zone is designated or when at least ninety percent of all facilities and infrastructure described in the water quality plan for the zone have been completed. See id.\",\n",
       "  \"The Court finds these aspects of section 26.179 particularly offensive. Yet a city cannot enforce any of its ordinances even one yard beyond its ETJ. Does this mean that landowners just outside a city's ETJ have been delegated legislative power because they may use their land free from regulation by a city? Obviously, the answer is no. The vast majority of land in Texas lies outside the boundaries of a city's ETJ. It is ludicrous to suggest that, since there are no regulations comparable to city nuisance and environmental regulations in rural areas or suburban areas outside ETJs, the Legislature has unconstitutionally allowed landowners to develop their property free from this type of governmental oversight.\",\n",
       "  \"The Court also totally ignores the fact that a city could not regulate water quality within its ETJ at all unless the Legislature gave it that authority. It is not an unconstitutional delegation when the Legislature restores landowners within a city's ETJ to the same status as those outside a city's ETJ. Under section 26.179, the Legislature simply returned to landowners within an ETJ rights that other landowners all across Texas enjoy.\",\n",
       "  'The rhetoric that is laced throughout the Court\\'s opinion, such as the statement that \"landowners\\' power to exempt themselves from the enforcement of municipal regulations is also a legislative power,\" 22 S.W.3d at 875, is no substitute for sound analysis of fundamental legal principles and concepts. The Court elevates a city\\'s power to regulate over that of the State. This is indefensible. If the State disapproves of regulations that cities have extended to their ETJs, the State may abolish those regulations or even abolish the ETJs in their entirety. It follows as surely as night follows day that a State may therefore release landowners in an ETJ from the grip of city regulation without unconstitutionally delegating legislative power.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'III',\n",
       "  'The provision in the Texas Constitution that prohibits the Legislature from delegating its legislative powers to private citizens *891 is Article III, Section 1.[5]See Proctor v. Andrews, 972 S.W.2d 729, 732-33 (Tex. 1998). Historically, what private property owners have chosen to do with their own land has not been a \"legislative power.\"',\n",
       "  'In 1917, the Texas Constitution was amended to provide that the preservation and conservation of natural resources, including water, were \"public rights and duties\" and that \"the Legislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.\" TEX.CONST. art. XVI, § 59(a). This provision does not strip away private property owners\\' rights to decide how to develop their land. It only directs the Legislature to pass \"all such laws as may be appropriate\" to preserve and conserve water. Id. Accordingly, landowners retain the right to make decisions about the development of their own property, subject to laws that the Legislature may pass regarding conservation and preservation of water. A private landowner\\'s decision about how to develop property does not become the exercise of \"legislative power\" within the meaning of Article III, Section 1 by virtue of Article XVI, Section 59.',\n",
       "  'The Court\\'s quarrel with the Legislature is, at bottom, not a question of delegation, but a question of whether, in the Court\\'s view, the laws that the Legislature has passed are \"appropriate\" to preserve and conserve water. Id. The Court has overstepped constitutionally prescribed boundaries. It is for the Legislature to decide what laws are \"appropriate\" to conserve water. That is not a function of this or any other court.',\n",
       "  'The statutes under scrutiny in this case permit landowners to make decisions, within limits, about how to use their own property. The Court concedes that section 26.179 does not give landowners \"power over the private property of others,\" or \"the power to apply the law to particular individuals other than themselves and their successors in interest.\" 22 S.W.3d at 879-80. The Court, however, struggles mightily to conjure up examples of how landowners\\' use of their own land might indirectly affect third parties. See 22 S.W.3d at 879. But those effects are no different from the effects that any use of land may have on a neighbor or on third parties tens or hundreds of miles away. The use of one\\'s own property does not implicate a delegation of legislative power. A delegation of legislative authority to private individuals or entities necessarily contemplates that those individuals or entities will have some direct say so over third parties. In cases that the Court cites regarding delegation, a private individual or group was empowered to directly control the actions or rights of another. See, e.g., Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Found., Inc. v. Lewellen, 952 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1997); County of Fairfax v. Fleet Indus. Park L.P., 242 Va. 426, 410 S.E.2d 669 (1991); Bayside Timber Co. v. Board of Supervisors, 20 Cal. App. 3d 1, 97 Cal. Rptr. 431 (1971). That is not what is at issue here.',\n",
       "  'The Court says that \"[w]ater quality regulation is a legislative power.\" 22 S.W.3d at 875. I agree. But I disagree with the Court that the Legislature has delegated water quality regulation to landowners under section 26.179. It is the Legislature who has determined the water quality standards. A landowner who elects not to comply with city ordinances that cover water quality must meet the State\\'s standards. Specifically, a landowner must have a plan for maintaining background levels of water quality in waterways or maintaining the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179. Section 26.179 includes detailed requirements for maintaining background levels of water quality. See id. § 26.179(b). A landowner must *892 also meet all then-existing state laws regarding water quality and all future state laws to the extent necessary to comply with federal law. See id. § 26.179(k), (m).',\n",
       "  'The Court insists that section 26.179 results in a delegation because legislative power includes \"the power to provide the details of the law, to promulgate rules and regulations to apply the law, and to ascertain conditions upon which existing laws may operate.\" 22 S.W.3d at 873. First, the Legislature has set forth the laws that must be followed within section 26.179 itself. The only matter left to a landowner is how he will physically capture the first 1.5 inches of rainfall or maintain background levels of water quality. Complying with the law is not the same as making the law. Second, nothing in section 26.179 gives landowners the power to make rules or regulations. Section 26.179 requires a landowner to submit a plan showing how it intends to meet the State-mandated water quality standards. That does not amount to giving landowner\\'s rule-making authority. But even if a water quality protection plan under section 26.179 could legitimately be characterized as imposing rules, to whom would those rules apply? As we have seen, the inescapable answer is that the plan only applies to the landowner who files it and his successors in interest. The Court concedes as well that section 26.179 does not give landowners any authority over the property of others. 22 S.W.3d at 877. Directing landowners to file and implement a water quality control plan that applies only to their own property does not amount to a delegation of legislative power.',\n",
       "  'The Legislature has determined the consequences if a landowner fails to meet the State-prescribed water quality standards. The Court obviously believes that those consequences are not severe enough. It extensively criticizes the Legislature\\'s scheme for regulating water quality, apparently finding it too minimal. See, e.g., 22 S.W.3d at 878-79. But that is not a call for this Court to make. The Legislature is empowered by the Texas Constitution to pass \"all such laws as may be appropriate\" to preserve and conserve water. TEX. CONST. art. XVI, § 59. The Legislature has done so. It has not delegated that responsibility to landowners. The Court cannot use its power to strike down legislation as unconstitutional simply because the Court does not think that the legislation goes far enough to maintain water quality in Austin, Texas.',\n",

       "  'The Court\\'s determination to strike down water quality laws rather than trying to uphold them is apparent when it applies the Boll Weevil factors. I would not reach those factors because there has been no delegation here. But I think it is important to illuminate the shallowness and transparency of the Court\\'s reasoning in its discussion of these factors and the Court\\'s failure to abide by the longstanding common-law tenet that \"`[i]f under any possible state of facts an act would be constitutional, the courts are bound to presume such facts exist.\\'\" Texas Workers\\' Compensation Comm\\'n v. Garcia, 893 S.W.2d 504, 520 (Tex.1995) (quoting Corsicana Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Sheppard, 123 Tex. 352, 71 S.W.2d 247, 250 (1934)).',\n",
       "  'Although the Court concludes that the third and fifth Boll Weevil factors weigh in favor of finding the \"delegation\" constitutional, the Court finds that the remaining factors tip the scales the other way. First, the Court says, there is no meaningful governmental review. This is belied by the fact that the TNRCC has rejected landowners\\' plans for a water quality protection zone under section 26.179 forty percent of the time. If the TNRCC is not providing meaningful review, why is it rejecting plans so frequently? Nevertheless, the Court is resolute in its failure to apply the well-established requirement for holding that a statute is unconstitutional on its face, namely, \"that the statute, by its terms, always operates unconstitutionally.\" Garcia, 893 S.W.2d at 518 (emphasis *893 added). How can the Court justify an ivory-tower pronouncement that this statute can never afford meaningful agency review when over in the agency offices meaningful review is actually happening, unless the Court has simply determined to say whatever it takes, true or not, to strike down this statute?',\n",
       "  'The Court also glosses over the fact that unless a zone has 1,000 or more acres, the plan cannot go into effect unless and until the TNRCC approves it. Then, the Court finds fault with the fact that the Legislature has placed the burden of proof on the TNRCC if an application is denied. Are we really prepared to say that the constitutionality of a statute turns on who has the burden of proof? Why should the State not have the burden of proof here? The State has the burden of proof when it seeks to restrict the exercise of rights such as those to life and liberty.',\n",
       "  \"The Court's obsession with elevating city ordinances above state regulation also crops up again in its analysis of the adequacy of governmental regulation and in its analysis of the fourth and sixth Boll Weevil factors. See 22 S.W.3d at 885, 886-87. But, as discussed above, the facts that the State rather than a city regulates, and that the State's regulations are less onerous than a city's, do not mean that the State has delegated its regulatory power to the private sector.\",\n",
       "  'In analyzing the second Boll Weevil factor, the Court faults section 26.179 because it does not provide for public hearings to give third parties an opportunity to be heard and it does not give a right of appeal to third parties. See 22 S.W.3d at 884-85. When a landowner in rural West Texas, who is far from a city\\'s ETJ, decides to subdivide and develop his property, is a hearing necessary so that neighbors or downstream water users can lodge-complaints? If the Legislature does not provide some means for third parties to appeal a landowner\\'s decision to subdivide and develop rural property, has the Legislature unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the private sector? I submit that the answer to these questions is a resounding \"no,\" and that the answer should be the same for other property owners in this state, regardless of whether their land is located within a city\\'s ETJ.',\n",

Local governments' power to regulate water quality in their ETJs derives solely from the authority granted them by the Legislature in section 26.177. By later passing section 26.179, the Legislature established comprehensive guidelines that empowered private landowners to make responsible decisions regarding water quality. In doing so, the Legislature reduced stifling regulations and administrative burdens imposed by cities under section 26.177. Today, the Court strips the Legislature of its legislative power to limit the regulatory authority it granted to local governments, and the Court improperly vests regulatory power in the hands of the City of Austin. The Court's decision usurps the Legislature's authority to determine public policy and to *899 make law and denigrates the private property rights of landowners. In addition, the Court demands more and more regulation, calling into question a number of existing and contemplated legislative policies and forcing the state down a dangerous road of increased regulation and administration and decreased privatization.\",\n",
       "  \"It is the Legislature's responsibility to regulate water quality in Texas. As noted, the Legislature chose to allow cities to regulate water quality in their ETJs via section 26.177. But the Court wholly fails to recognize that the Legislature has the power to rewrite, restrict, or even eliminate section 26.177 without violating the Texas Constitution. The City of Austin's right to regulate water in its ETJ was created by the Legislature. Surely it cannot be unconstitutional for the Legislature to limit that authority. Section 26.179 is merely a vehicle to do just that\\x97it curtails the regulatory and administrative powers given to the City in section 26.177. But the Court concludes that this reduction in the City's regulatory authority is invalid, and in doing so the Court displaces the Legislature's policy decision with its own regarding how water should be regulated in Texas.\",\n",
       "  \"The necessary import of the Court's opinion is that by enacting section 26.177, the Legislature can delegate to local governments the authority to regulate, but its hands are tied when it wants to limit that authority. In reaching its conclusion, the Court fails to acknowledge that section 26.179 provides more comprehensive regulation of water quality for subject landowners than for the vast numbers of Texas landowners outside a city's ETJ who are not subject to section 26.177. It can only be presumed that the Court would hold that these numerous landowners are also somehow victims of an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Given the Court's decision today, my suggestion to the Legislature is to eliminate section 26.177 and simply start over.\",\n",
       "  \"Besides improperly tying the Legislature's hands, the Court also fails to acknowledge the potential consequences of its decision. The Legislature has demonstrated its desire to empower individuals through a variety of privatization initiatives such as school choice and school vouchers.[2] Would the Court's opinion mandate that such policy choices be stricken as unconstitutional delegations? The same question applies to the Legislature's ability to establish private prisons.[3] And what about existing legislative grants of eminent domain power to private entities? [4] The Court cannot reconcile such policies with its decision. In addition to rendering the viability of these and other legislative policies questionable, the Court's decision leads the state down a dangerous path that requires more and more regulation and less privatization. It is the Legislature's policy choice\\x97not the Court's\\x97that should determine the amount of regulation needed.\",\n",
       "  \"Section 26.179 provides comprehensive water-quality regulation to applicable landowners. The Court concedes that section *900 26.179 provides fairly detailed statutory standards to guide landowners in formulating their initial water-quality plans. 22 S.W.3d at 887. And the Court concedes that in addition to the extensive requirements in section 26.179, landowners remain subject to pre-existing state water-quality regulations, future state water-quality regulations necessary to comply with federal standards, and the TNRCC's powers to enforce those regulations. 22 S.W.3d at 887-88. But the Court undertakes its own policy analysis and proclaims that the legislatively established regulations in section 26.179 are insufficient. The Court says the numerous applicable regulations do not go far enough and that private citizens have too much latitude to make their own decisions\\x97despite the fact that the regulations the Court deems to be inadequate are so comprehensive that the Court's mere synopsis of them occupies nine paragraphs of its opinion.\",\n",
       "  'Despite the numerous existing regulations, the Court wants more. The Court creates an impossible standard requiring the Legislature to regulate the minutia of land development. For example, although section 26.179(b) requires three years of monitoring after the completion of each phase of development, the Court wants more monitoring. The Court concludes that because the statute does not require that development occur in phases, no monitoring would be required until a zone is completely developed. 22 S.W.3d at 882. Although the statute may not require specific \"phases,\" simple logistics surely requires that development occur in stages. Because the nature of developments may vary, the Legislature could not prescribe the number or types of phases for every development, and the Court should not attempt to force the Legislature to do so. Moreover, the Court complains that developers must modify water-quality plans only for future development phases. 22 S.W.3d at 882-83. But how could they modify in the past? And, section 26.179(b)(2) appropriately requires modification of operational and maintenance practices in existing phases whenever water quality has not been maintained.',\n",

In a facial challenge such as this, it is the challenger\\'s burden to show that the statute always operates unconstitutionally. Barshop v.

Rather than demonstrating that section 26.179 always operates unconstitutionally, the Court ignores the standard, ignores the fact that the statute operated constitutionally when applied to two plans that were denied by the TNRCC, and instead insists on hypothesizing the ways in which the statute \"could\" operate unconstitutionally. In doing so, the Court fundamentally changes the analysis of a facial challenge as it has been repeatedly stated and applied by this Court and the United States Supreme Court.

To the contrary, the Legislature, by enacting section 26.179, did limit certain municipal powers under section 26.177, but it did not delegate the power to suspend laws or any other legislative authority to the landowners. It simply curtailed the City's authority within its ETJ and provided the landowners with an alternative state-established and regulated water-quality scheme. Because the Legislature itself, via section 26.179(i), mandated that certain city regulations be suspended, and determined which regulations would be suspended, there has been no delegation of the power to suspend laws to the landowners. In addition, because the landowners must meet specific standards established by the Legislature in section 26.179 and because the landowners are comprehensively regulated by the TNRCC and existing state and federal laws in implementing those standards, section 26.179 does not delegate any other governmental authority to the landowners.\",\n",

Chapter 26 of the Water Code governs water-quality maintenance and delegates primary responsibility for implementing water-quality management functions, including enforcement actions, to the TNRCC. See TEX. WATER CODE §§ 26.011, 26.0136. In addition, the Code delegates some water-quality maintenance responsibility to local governments. See, e.g., id. § 26.0136.',\n",
       "  \"One such delegation occurred in 1971, when the Legislature delegated certain water-quality management authority to municipalities via section 26.177. The version of section 26.177 in effect in 1995 required that every city with a population of 5000 or greater establish a water-pollution-control and abatement program for the city, and also allowed smaller cities to do so. See Act of May 29, 1971, 62d Leg., R.S., ch. 612, § 7, 1971 Tex. Gen. Laws 1974, 1980. These city programs encompass the entire city and may include those areas within the city's ETJ that the city determines should be included to enable *902 the city to achieve its objectives for the area within its territorial jurisdiction. See id. § 26.177(b). Cities have broad powers to establish water-pollution-control programs under section 26.177, both in the city limits and in the ETJ. But this broad authority to regulate water quality in the ETJ is wholly derived from legislative grants of authority.\",\n",
       "  \"Similarly, a city's authority to regulate land development in its ETJ is wholly derived from a legislative grant of authority. Section 212.003 of the Local Government Code provides that a city may extend to the ETJ its municipal ordinances governing plats and subdivisions of land, but cannot regulate (1) the use of buildings or property, (2) the bulk, height, or number of buildings constructed, (3) the size of buildings, or (4) the number of residential units that can be built per acre. See TEX.LOC. GOV'T CODE § 212.003. If no municipal ordinances are extended to the ETJ, only county land-use regulations apply.\",\n",
       "  \"Austin's approach to protecting water quality under its section 26.177 authority has been to regulate land development, primarily by limiting the uses and development intensities of land. See Bray et al., Environmental Permits: Land Use Regulation and Policy Implementation in Texas, 23 St. Mary's L.J. 841, 884 (1992). As noted, a city's authority to regulate land development in the ETJ under the Local Government Code is limited. But because Austin has used water-control measures under its section 26.177 authority to effectively limit land development\\x97rather than using its express (but limited) authority to regulate land development under section 212.003 of the Local Government Code\\x97 the City has evaded most of the Local Government Code's limitations on cities' land-use regulation powers in the ETJ.

WATER CODE § 26.177(b). Its purpose is to prevent city-established limitations on land development under their section 26.177 authority in order \"to provide the flexibility necessary to facilitate the development of the land within [a water-quality-protection] zone,\" while at the same time ensuring the non-degradation of water quality within the zone via TNRCC oversight.

See TEX. CONST. art. I, § 28 (\"No power of suspending laws in this State shall be exercised except by the Legislature.\"). These arguments are interrelated and should be considered together.',\n",
       "  'To determine whether a delegation of the power to suspend laws has occurred, courts focus on the statutory language. See Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Found., Inc. v. Lewellen, 952 S.W.2d 454, 473-74 (Tex.1997). Section 26.179(d) allows landowners of a contiguous tract of land in excess of 1000 acres to designate the tract as a zone. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.179(d). Owners of tracts containing fewer than 1000 acres but more than 500 acres may also designate a zone, but only with prior TNRCC approval. See id. A landowner may achieve \"water-quality protection\" within a zone by either (1) maintaining background levels of water quality in waterways or (2) capturing and retaining the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas. See id. § 26.179(a).',\n",
       "  \"When designating a zone, the landowner must describe the zone by metes and bounds and include a general description of the proposed land uses within the zone (the land-use plan), a water-quality plan for the zone, and a general description of the water-quality facilities and infrastructure to be constructed for water-quality protection in the zone. See id. § 26.179(e). The water-quality plan must be signed and sealed by a registered professional engineer acknowledging that the plan is designed to achieve one of the two water-quality protection standards of section 26.179 (capturing rainfall or maintaining background levels of water quality). See id. § 26.179(g). The water-quality plan must be submitted to the TNRCC for approval. See id. A city may not enforce in a zone any of its ordinances, land-use ordinances, rules, or requirements that are inconsistent with the land-use plan and the water-quality plan or that in any way limit, modify, or impair the ability to implement and operate the water-quality plan and the land-use plan within the zone as filed. See id. § 26.179(i). Thus, section 26.179 creates two regulatory schemes. In areas where no zone is designated, all applicable city regulations may be enforced. But where a zone is designated, section 26.179's state-regulated scheme applies and certain city regulations and powers are rendered inapplicable.\",\n",
       "  'To begin with, the Legislature\\'s allowing landowners to choose between alternative, legislatively established regulatory schemes is not a delegation. See Helvering v. Lerner Stores Corp., 314 U.S. 463, 468, 62 S. Ct. 341, 86 L. Ed. 482 (1941) (holding that a statute allowing taxpayers to choose between alternative tax bases was not a delegation); see also Thomas Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, 242 U.S. 526, 531, 37 S.

The Legislature, via section 26.179(i), intended to and did suspend certain city regulations and powers (the power to annex, the power to collect fees and assessments, and the power to enforce any ordinances or regulations inconsistent with the water-quality and land-use plans), consistent with section 26.179\\'s stated purpose to facilitate development while maintaining water quality. Simply repealing section 26.177 or suspending all city regulations in the ETJ\\x97which the Legislature could have done\\x97would have been too broad to serve the Legislature\\'s goal of removing only those city ordinances and powers that unduly hindered development. Section 26.177 is \"subject to\" section 26.179, and remains in full effect in all areas except where a zone is designated. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.177(b). But even where a zone is designated, only city regulations and powers \"inconsistent with\" a landowner\\'s plan are suspended. See id. § 26.179(i).',\n",
       "  \"Although a landowner's plan is developed in accordance with section 26.179 and is subject to TNRCC review, the Legislature could not know which city ordinances and powers would conflict with a specific landowner's plan in a specific city, and thus could not specifically denote which ordinances and powers would be suspended. To further section 26.179's purpose, the Legislature chose to suspend only those city regulations inconsistent with a landowner's attempt to comply with the state scheme for water-quality regulation established in section 26.179, thereby allowing water-quality regulation and development under section 26.179 without undue interference from the city. Fostering development by achieving this balance is a sufficient state interest for the Legislature's suspension of these city regulations and powers, and is consistent with the Legislature's stated Water Code policy of maintaining water quality consistent with economic development. See id. § 26.003. As both the Court and the City concede, this legislation serves this state interest throughout Texas by limiting cities' regulatory powers throughout the State.\",\n",

Via section 26.179, the Legislature suspended those laws \"inconsistent with\" the landowner\\'s water-quality and land-use plans, which must be formulated in compliance with section 26.179 and approved by the TNRCC. Id. § 26.179(i). Nowhere does the statute give landowners the authority to determine which ordinances are inconsistent with their plans. They are not given any license to themselves suspend any regulations. Nor are they even given any rights against the city if the city fails to comply with section 26.179(i) by enforcing regulations. Instead, if the city enforced other ordinances or regulations that a landowner believed to be inconsistent with its plans, the landowner would have to resort to the courts for relief, in which case the courts, not the landowners, would decide which city water-quality regulations were inconsistent with the plans. Thus, I would reject the City\\'s arguments that section 26.179 violates article III, section 1 and article I, section 28 of the Texas Constitution because the statute does not delegate the power to suspend laws to the landowners.',\n",

But even for landowners with tracts exceeding 1000 acres (who may designate the tract as a zone without prior approval), section 26.179 provides that certain water-quality standards must be met. These standards place substantial limitations on a landowner's actions and are enforced by the TNRCC.\",\n",

Id. § 26.179(a). Regardless of which option is chosen, the landowner must formulate a water-quality plan, which must be submitted to and approved by the TNRCC. See id. § 26.179(g). The TNRCC has the power to disapprove any plan if implementation of the plan will not reasonably attain one of the two defined water-quality-protection standards.[5]See id. Thus, the Legislature defined the water-quality-protection standards, and the TNRCC is the arbiter of whether a landowner has satisfied one of those standards.\",\n",
       "  'If a landowner chooses to maintain background levels of water quality, section 26.179(b) imposes extensive monitoring requirements. The landowner must maintain background levels of water quality in waterways comparable to those levels that existed before new development. See id. § 26.179(b). Background levels are established by either (1) collecting data from one or more sites located within the zone or (2) if such data are unavailable, from calculations performed and certified by a registered professional engineer using certain *906 methods approved by the TNRCC until such data are available. See id. Background levels for undeveloped sites must be verified based on monitoring results from other areas of property within the zone prior to its development. See id. And, the determination of background levels of water quality must be signed and sealed by a registered professional engineer. See id. § 26.179(g). Each new phase of development requires monitoring for a three-year period, with a minimum of four samples taken per year at four different locations where runoff occurs. See id. § 26.179(b). Results of monitoring and a description of the best management practices being used in the zone must be summarized and submitted to the TNRCC each year during development, unless the TNRCC determines that monitoring is no longer required. See id. If performance monitoring and best management practices indicate that background levels were not maintained during the previous year, the landowner must (1) modify water-quality plans for future phases of development to the extent reasonably feasible and practical and (2) modify operational and maintenance practices in existing phases to the extent reasonably feasible and practical. See id. If a landowner chooses to retain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall, this water-quality monitoring is not required. See id.',\n",

For example, section 26.179(k) provides that development in a zone must comply with all state laws and TNRCC rules regulating water quality that are in effect on the date the zone is designated. Id. § 26.179(k). Thus, each phase of development in a zone must satisfy these requirements. Section 26.179(k) further provides that nothing in section 26.179 shall supersede or interfere with the applicability of water-quality measures or regulations adopted by a conservation and reclamation district comprising more than two counties and that apply to the watershed area of a surface lake or surface reservoir that impounds at least 4000 acre-feet of water. Id. And, section 26.179(m) provides that the TNRCC may require and enforce additional water-quality-protection measures to comply with mandatory federal water-quality requirements, standards, permit provisions, or regulations. Id. § 26.179(m). Last, the city may still enforce any city ordinances and regulations that are not inconsistent with the land-use and water-quality plans. See id. § 26.179(i).\",\n",
       "  'The TNRCC has authority to enforce these provisions under section 26.179(m) and under other provisions of Chapter 26 such as section 26.019, which expressly provides the TNRCC with authority \"to issue orders and make determinations necessary to effectuate the purposes of [Chapter 26].\" See id. § 26.019; see also id. § 26.0136 (\"The [TNRCC] is the agency with primary responsibility for implementation of water-quality management functions, including enforcement actions, within the state.\"). In addition, other sections of the Water Code clearly establish that the TNRCC has \"general jurisdiction over water and water rights\" and the state\\'s water-quality program, and that the TNRCC has the power to perform any acts \"necessary and convenient to the exercise of its jurisdiction and powers as provided by [the Water Code] and other laws.\" Id. §§ 5.013(a), 5.102(a).',\n",
       "  \"Thus, for landowners designating a zone, section 26.179 simply replaces city water-quality regulations established pursuant to section 26.177 with section 26.179's legislatively established standards\\x97with TNRCC oversight. In addition to the city, state, and federal standards described in the preceding paragraphs, the landowners must develop a water-quality plan that will meet one of the two water-quality standards *907 established by the Legislature. See id. § 26.179(g). Compliance with section 26.179's standards and additional state and TNRCC rules and regulations is monitored and enforced by the TNRCC. See id. § 26.179(g), (m).\",\n",
       "  'As noted previously, once a water-quality plan is in effect, if a landowner has opted to maintain background levels of water quality but fails, he must modify existing operational and maintenance practices, modify his plan for future phases, and obtain TNRCC approval of the modified plan. See id. § 26.179(b), (g). The TNRCC need not approve a modified plan unless it finds the new plan will reasonably attain the water-quality protection standards of section 26.179. See id. § 26.179(g).',\n",
       "  'The Court also points to the fact that, if a landowner opts to capture the first 1.5 inches of rainfall, no water-quality monitoring is required. Simply because monitoring is not required does not mean that legislative authority has been delegated. The Legislature defined capturing 1.5 inches of rainfall as a water-quality-protection standard. If a landowner submits a plan to capture the first 1.5 inches of rainfall, which is sworn by a registered engineer and approved by the TNRCC, the landowner has complied with the standard created by the Legislature. The landowner is required to continue to capture rainfall throughout the project\\'s development; the Legislature states that doing so will \"achieve water-quality protection;\" and the TNRCC can enforce this requirement. The simple lack of water-quality monitoring does not indicate that any legislative authority has been delegated to the landowners under this scheme.',\n",
       "  'The Court also incorrectly concludes that section 26.179(b) \"prohibits the TNRCC from monitoring or requiring monitoring\" in zones that are capturing rainfall. 22 S.W.3d at 883. The TNRCC requires landowners in such zones to maintain certain records and submit them with \"an assessment of the water quality plan\\'s success in meeting the TNRCC\\'s water quality requirements.\" 30 TEX. ADMIN. Code § 216.8. As noted, the TNRCC has authority to enforce TNRCC regulations in effect at the time of the zone\\'s designation, and may require landowners to submit records and reports indicating whether those requirements are satisfied. Although section 26.179(b) states that \"[w]ater quality monitoring shall not be required in areas using the methodology described by Subsection (a)(2) [capturing rainfall],\" a reasonable interpretation of that language, which comes at the end of the description of the water-quality monitoring required of zones electing to maintain background water quality, means that the water-quality monitoring described in section 26.179(b) is not applicable to such zones. It does not necessarily mean that no reporting or assessment of any type may be required to enforce other regulations. For example, if mandatory federal requirements required monitoring, certainly such monitoring could be required and enforced under section 26.179(m) despite section 26.179(b)\\'s apparently broad prohibition. Similarly, if state laws or TNRCC rules in effect at the time of the zone\\'s designation require monitoring, such monitoring could be required and enforced by the TNRCC.',\n",
       "  'In sum, by enacting section 26.179, the Legislature established the two water-quality standards to be applied (capturing rainfall or maintaining background levels of water quality), and the methods by which landowners must comply with those standards. As the Court acknowledges, the statute provides specific standards and the specific means to comply with them. The only discretion given the landowners is in designing and implementing the land-use and water-quality plans to satisfy these standards. Section 26.179 does not delegate legislative power merely because the landowners may choose one of the two legislatively established methods and devise their own specific plans to meet the standards imposed. See Perot v. Federal Election Comm\\'n, 97 F.3d 553, 559-60 *908 (D.C.Cir.1996) (\"One might view [allowing organizations to decide what specific `objective criteria\\' to use in holding a debate] as a `delegation,\\' because the organization must use their discretion.... But in that respect, virtually any regulation of a private party could be described as a `delegation\\' of authority, since the party must normally exercise some discretion in interpreting what actions it must take to comply.\"); Whaley v. State, 168 Ala. 152, 52 So. 941, 941 (1909) (holding that a streetcar company\\'s right to make rules concerning transfers was not a delegation, because the right to make rules concerning transfers existed independently of the act, and the authority given was not the delegation of the authority to legislate). Otherwise, only complete governmental control and oversight would avoid an unconstitutional delegation. The Legislature should not be forced into the business of detailing the development plans for all parcels of land throughout the state; it is sufficient for the Legislature to establish a framework (through the TNRCC) to ensure that its standards are being satisfied.',\n",

Lewellen, 952 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1997).

Id. at 486, 484-86 (Hecht, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The foundation represented the interests of growers who elected the board members, and the foundation was authorized to conduct referenda. The board then devised eradication guidelines and applied them to others\\' property. It could impose assessments and enter others\\' property to carry out its eradication programs, and could even require a cotton grower to destroy his crop. All of these powers were exercised without any meaningful review by a governmental agency. See id. Here, there is no such representational system, landowners make decisions only with regard to their own property, and the decisions are subject to TNRCC review and approval both before and during implementation. Thus, in contrast to the situation in Boll Weevil, landowners designating a zone under section 26.179 control only their own property, are subject to legislatively defined standards and meaningful regulation, and are ultimately accountable to the TNRCC and the courts.

I find some irony in the City's argument that a statute can be unconstitutionally local or special because its classification is too broad or general. Moreover, the City's interpretation of section 26.179's application is erroneously overbroad: to trigger section 26.179, the City must enforce or enact three different ordinances attempting to regulate water quality or control or abate water pollution\\x97so that there are three different standards governing water quality\\x97during a five-year period. The legislative history indicates that the Legislature was primarily concerned with a City's changing water-quality standards so that three or more different standards would apply during any five-year period. The Legislature believed that application of three or more different water-quality standards in a five-year period would lead to regulatory chaos that would in turn hinder development. Accordingly, consistent with this legislative intent, I would construe section 26.179 as applying when a City enacts or enforces three different water-quality ordinances within a five-year period.[9] Thus, enforcing or enacting an ordinance triggers section 26.179 only insofar as applicable water-quality standards are changed. Accordingly, section 26.179 is not triggered simply by a City's enforcing three long-standing ordinances because standards are not changed. It is not arbitrary or unreasonable for the Legislature to determine that applying three or more water-quality standards in a five-year period could cause uncertainty that hampers a landowner's plans for development, whether or not the regulations are in the end applied to the landowner.\",\n",
       "  'As noted, it is not necessary that the legislation advance a matter of statewide interest, but whether it does so is a significant factor in determining whether the Legislature\\'s classifications are reasonable. In addition, the substantiality of the class (i.e., the number of persons affected by the legislation) must be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the classifications. Promoting development without unnecessary regulatory chaos is a matter of statewide interest. See, e.g., TEX. WATER CODE § 26.003 (\"It is the policy of this state ... to maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with ... the economic development of the state....\"). Although section 26.179 currently affects only the City of Austin, the City admits that section 26.179 creates an \"open\" class, which will include other cities who choose to enact additional water-quality ordinances. The City raises the possibility that other cities may hesitate to enact new water-quality ordinances in the future to avoid falling into this class. Rather than militating against section 26.179\\'s reasonableness, this possibility demonstrates that section 26.179\\'s classification reasonably advances the statute\\'s purpose. Thus, I would hold that section\\'s 26.179\\'s three-ordinance classification is reasonable.',\n",
       "  \"*914 I would also hold that section 26.179(c)'s population classification has a reasonable basis. When the Legislature passed section 26.179 in 1995, section 26.177 required only cities with populations greater than five thousand to establish water-pollution-control and abatement programs. See Act of May 29, 1971, 62d Leg., R.S., ch. 612, § 7, 1971 Tex. Gen. Laws 1974, 1980, amended by Act of May 5, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 101, § 5, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 193, 197 (section 26.177 now provides that cities of 10,000 or more are required to establish a water-quality program if directed to do so by the TNRCC). These programs could include areas in the cities' ETJs. See TEX. WATER CODE § 26.177(b). It was not unreasonable for the Legislature to provide section 26.179's option only in the ETJs of the cities that section 26.177 required to implement water plans. Moreover, the five-thousand person population threshold distinguishes between small cities with half-mile ETJs and larger cities with ETJs ranging from one to five miles. See TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE § 42.021(1)-(5). In a city with a population of fewer than five thousand inhabitants, the zone would necessarily be within one-half mile of the city's boundaries, while it may be up to five miles from a larger city's boundaries. The Legislature could have reasonably believed that it was necessary to exempt the state's smallest cities from section 26.179 because it would disproportionately affect their power to regulate water quality immediately adjacent to their boundaries.\",\n",

This assertion is wrong. For the would-be developer at least, forming a water-quality-protection zone will likely provide more regulatory certainty and \"provide the flexibility necessary to develop the land\" in areas previously subject to numerous changing standards because the landowner will be subject to only the standards detailed in section 26.179.',\n",

The Interpretive Commentary to article I, section 28 states that it prohibits \"any person ..., except the Legislature, from setting aside the law,\" and even when the Legislature suspends *915 the law, \"it must make the suspension general, and cannot suspend [the law] for individual cases or for particular localities.\" TEX.

But even assuming that the City does in fact have a vested right affected by section 26.179, the City\\'s argument fails. The City contends that section 26.179\\'s retroactive impairment of its rights is unconstitutional because section 26.179 is a \"special interest statute designed to assist private developers within the City\\'s ETJ\" and therefore the Legislature did not enact section 26.179 as part of a valid exercise of the police power to safeguard the public safety and welfare.

Plaintiffs allege that Intratex Gas Company did not take natural gas in ratable proportions from the wells of more than 900 producers. The trial court defined the plaintiff class as consisting of producers of natural gas whose gas was taken by Intratex between 1978 and 1988 in less than ratable proportions, and certified it under rule 42 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The court of appeals held that the trial court properly certified the class. 960 S.W.2d 389. We conclude that because the class definition is improperly based on the ultimate issue of alleged liability in the case, the trial court abused its discretion when it certified the class. Because we cannot modify the class definition in this case without interfering with the trial court's discretion and oversight of the class action, we decline to redefine the class on appeal. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\",\n",
       "  'Intratex is an intrastate pipeline company that purchases gas as the first purchaser from several thousand wells in west Texas along its Oasis pipeline. Plaintiffs, who are producers of natural gas, sued on behalf of a \"class of persons who, at any given time from 1978 to the present, have held overriding royalty interests or working interests in natural gas producing properties on which the production was dedicated to or purchased by\" Intratex. They allege that from 1978 to 1988, Intratex did not take gas ratably from them.',\n",
       "  'Plaintiffs\\' ratable-take claim is a discrimination claim. Texas law requires an intrastate pipeline like Intratex to buy gas without discrimination (i.e., \"ratably\") from the producers selling to it at the wellhead; the law also requires the producers to produce ratably. The source of the ratability doctrine is the Texas Common Purchasers Act. See TEX. NAT. RES. CODE §§ 111.081-.097; see also 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.34. Plaintiffs predicate their claim on section 111.086 of the Act, which provides that a purchaser cannot discriminate in favor of one producer against another producer in the same field, and cannot discriminate \"unjustly\" *401 or \"unreasonably\" between fields.[1] TEX. NAT. RES.CODE § 111.086.',\n",
       "  \"The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted ratable-take rules to implement section 111.086. See TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.34. The rules impose ratability obligations on producers and purchasers to prevent waste, protect correlative rights, prevent discrimination, and conserve the state's natural resources. See id. § 3.34(b). The Commission's regulations require that a first purchaser nominate gas ratably, and in accordance with the purchaser's market demand. See id. To guard against discrimination, the regulations prohibit a purchaser from considering the contractual price, agreed upon by the purchaser and the producer, in nominating or taking natural gas. See id. § 3.34(f)(1), (g)(1). A purchaser's nominations are one of the factors the Commission considers when setting a gas well's allowables, which are used in determining the maximum amount a well is permitted to produce.\",\n",
       "  'Intratex purchased gas along the Oasis pipeline pursuant to contracts with the Plaintiffs; under these gas contracts, prices paid for production from some wells were lower than those paid for production from other wells. In 1978 and 1984, Intratex executed contracts with Dow Chemical Company that allowed Intratex, as the contractual first purchaser, to opt not to take delivery of gas at certain wells in certain production fields. Plaintiffs contend that Intratex selected wells to be part of the Dow-waiver \"program\" based on those wells\\' ability to produce gas in large quantities, and because the contractual prices were far below the spot-market price and system-wide weighted average cost of gas. Under these \"Dow-waiver agreements,\" Intratex waived to Dow its proportion of gas under specific gas-purchase contracts so that Dow received the gas and made payments to Intratex at a price calculated according to an agreed-upon formula. The Dow-waiver agreements allegedly enabled Intratex to nominate waiver fields with certain low-cost waiver wells higher than nonwaiver fields, which in turn allowed Intratex to take high volumes of gas from the waiver fields below the market price or system-wide price. Plaintiffs further contend that, rather than spreading the gas takes ratably system-wide, the waiver wells were produced in high, nonratable quantities under the Dow-waiver agreements.[2]',\n",
       "  \"During the three-day certification hearing, Plaintiffs' expert, Don Rhodes, testified that Intratex had taken disproportionate shares of natural gas from approximately 970 wells between 1978 and 1988. Rhodes conducted a study of Intratex's takes over the relevant period. He claimed to have identified, based on separate gas takings, those wells that were overtaken and those that were undertaken. According to Rhodes, between 1978 and 1988, Intratex took large quantities of low-priced gas while taking less high-priced gas. In response, Intratex presented its own expert, Don George, who challenged Rhodes's methodology. Based on George's testimony, Intratex argued that a class definition derived from a suspect study could not meet the rule 42 requirements.\",\n",
       "  \"After hearing the certification evidence, the trial court granted Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class, but only on the issue of whether Intratex took ratably from the class members.

The court of appeals held that Intratex\\'s criticisms of the trial court\\'s class definition were merits based and thus needed to be decided at trial. Id. at 394-95. It further concluded that while problems in the class definition might eventually require the trial court to modify the definition or decertify the class, merits-based issues should not defeat certification at such an early stage of the litigation. Id.

       "  \"On petition for review, Intratex argues that the class-certification order must be reversed because not only have Plaintiffs failed to fulfill the rule 42(a) and (b)(4) prerequisites, but the class definition is fundamentally defective. Specifically, Intratex argues that Plaintiffs did not satisfy the burdens imposed by rule 42(a) for class certification because: (1) ratability is an inherently individual determination, hence there is no common question of law or fact to be decided at trial; (2) the class representatives' claims are not typical of the claims of all class members; and (3) the proposed class representatives cannot adequately protect the interests of the class when intra-class antagonisms and conflicts of interest abound.\",\n",

Intratex argues that the trial court\\'s class definition turns on the central question of alleged liability\\x97 whether Intratex took gas from Plaintiffs in less than ratable shares. Therefore, the trial court created a \"fail-safe\" class, that is, a class bound only by a judgment favorable to Plaintiffs, but not by an adverse judgment. According to Intratex, a fail-safe class, by definition, is not objective, and membership in the class cannot be determined until final judgment. Additionally, Intratex asserts that redefining the class to focus on the producers excluded from the Dow-waiver agreements, as Plaintiffs suggest, would not eliminate the problems associated with maintaining the suit as a class action.',\n",

Failure to define a class precisely creates a substantial risk that putative class members cannot adequately exercise their right to opt out of or remain in the suit before they are bound by a class judgment.

Second, the class definition determines the nature of the relief that can be awarded and who is entitled to that relief. See 5 MOORE, supra, § 23.21(3). Finally, clearly defining the class identifies the plaintiffs who will be bound by the judgment if they lose, and insures that those actually harmed by the defendant's wrongful conduct will receive the relief ultimately awarded.

Data Transfer, Inc., 164 F.R.D. 400, 403 (E.D.Pa.1995) (finding proposed definition untenable because determining class membership would require mini-hearings on the merits of each case). An imprecise class definition, which does not give rise to presently ascertainable class members, undermines judicial economy and efficiency, thereby interfering with one of the primary purposes of class-action suits. See 5 Moore, supra, § 23.02. Thus, the class definition must meet a minimum standard of definiteness for the trial court to proceed with certification. We note, however, that a class definition will not fail merely because every potential class member cannot be identified at the suit\\'s commencement. See Carpenter v.

If judgment is rendered for Plaintiffs, the various producers\\' ability to exercise their right to opt out of the class action will have been compromised because the judgment will bind those producers who were taken from nonratably. But if Intratex wins at trial, there is no class because its existence is dependent on a finding that Plaintiffs were taken from nonratably. Plaintiffs cannot be bound by such a judgment because without a class, there is no way to ascertain class membership. Certification of the class under these circumstances is clearly impermissible. Furthermore, while the trial court possesses significant discretion to modify the class definition or even decertify the class as the case develops, the trial court must still certify only those classes that are sufficiently defined and meet the rule 42 requirements.

Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that it is well within this Court's authority to redefine the class because the record reveals that Plaintiffs, both in their pleadings and at the certification hearing, requested a precisely defined class of those producers excluded from the Dow-waiver agreements.

In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 643 F.2d 195, 225 (5th Cir.1981) (holding that trial court\\'s inherent power to manage class actions gives it discretion to decide when to review adequacy of settlements); see also 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1785 (2d ed.1986). First, the class definition is \"a matter within the broad discretion of the district court.\" Battle v. Pennsylvania, 629 F.2d 269, 271 n. 1 (3rd Cir.1980). The trial court is also accorded discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a class certification. See Tana Oil & Gas Corp. v. Bates, 978 S.W.2d 735, 740 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, no pet.); American Express Travel Related Servs. Co. v. Walton, 883 S.W.2d 703, 707 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1994, no writ). In making a class-certification decision, the trial court in the first instance must determine whether a class exists, and must ensure that the class is properly defined, based on the available evidence. See 7B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, supra, § 1760. Appellate courts should be reluctant to redefine a fundamentally flawed class definition because the parameters of the new definition may not be evident from the record, and unlike trial courts, appellate courts do not have access to any additional relevant evidence that may facilitate evaluating the definition. Indeed, the recasting of the class definition by an appellate court raises concerns similar to those raised when an appellate court certifies a class that the trial court previously determined was not suitable for class status:',\n",
       "  'Courts of appeals are less likely to direct the certification of a class than to direct a decertification simply because it is easier to notice abusively exercised discretion, or legal error, in a certification already granted, than it is to pick one hypothetical class definition, from a myriad of possible definitions, and confidently conclude that one definition is so clearly the right one that the [trial] *407 court abused its discretion in failing to certify that one class.',\n",

Jackson, 928 S.W.2d 583, 587 (Tex.App.- San Antonio 1996, writ dism\\'d w.o.j.). For example, the contours of the case may change after discovery is completed and as the parties prepare for trial, necessitating modification of the class definition. See Richardson v. Byrd, 709 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.1983). Rule 42(c)(1) invests the trial court with the responsibility of managing the class action, and provides it with the tools to respond to changes in the case\\'s development.[8] Prescribing the class definition for the trial court, therefore, interferes with the trial court\\'s discretion to monitor the class. Cf. Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 379-80 (2d Cir.1997) (remanding to trial court to identify appropriate subclasses in the first instance with suggestions for possible subclasses). Thus the trial court\\'s discretion to define, modify, subclassify, or decertify in response to the case\\'s development counsels in favor of remanding to the trial court when an appellate court identifies definitional problems. See Richardson, 709 F.2d at 1019 (noting that \"complex [class action] cases cannot be run from the tower of the appellate court given its distinct institutional role and that it has before it printed words rather than people\").',\n",
       "  \"We note that some appellate courts have redefined a class in those limited instances when correcting the definitional infirmity did not interfere with the trial court's discretion and oversight of the class action.[9] Redefining a class in those circumstances furthers resolution of class-certification issues and conserves judicial and litigant resources by avoiding repeated and unnecessary appeals. However, we are not presented with such an opportunity here.\",\n",
       "  'In this case, we disagree with Plaintiffs that this Court can easily recast the class definition from the record to include those producers excluded from the Dow-waiver agreements. We have already determined that the present class definition must be abandoned because it is fundamentally flawed. Plaintiffs propose a wholly new class. They acknowledge as much by highlighting that they presented two distinct certification theories to the trial court: one based on takings under the Dow-waiver agreements, and the other based on a common course of nonratable takings posited by the Rhodes study. *408 That these theories are distinct counsels against appellate redefinition of the class.',\n",
       "  \"The trial court defined a class based on the Rhodes study's identification of those producers who had been taken from nonratably. While the pleadings and the record of the class-certification proceedings mention the Dow-waiver program, the trial court and the parties focused primarily on the methodology and results of the Rhodes study at the certification hearing. As a result, the parameters of the proposed new class are not easily identified from the record. Thus, if we were to redefine the class, we would be assuming the trial court's discretion to define the class under rule 42.\",\n",
       "  \"Furthermore, the trial court on remand will still have to determine whether the newly defined class satisfies the rule 42(a) and (b)(4) requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy of representation, and predominance. That decision will require the trial court to resolve questions of fact, as well as legal issues, from this record or whatever additional evidence is developed in the trial court. For this Court to redefine the class in this case would therefore constrain the trial court by imposing on it a definition it would be foreclosed from changing, even if the proceedings on remand revealed a more appropriate class definition or if later case developments called for modification under rule 42(c)(1). In light of the record and the trial court's considerable authority to monitor this class action, including its discretion to certify, modify, or decertify the class if it becomes necessary, we cannot redefine the class. For these same reasons, we cannot decide in this case, as Intratex urges, whether attaining a precise class definition is futile.\",\n",
       "  \"Without a sufficiently defined class to bring this action, Plaintiffs cannot currently meet rule 42's prerequisites. Cf. Metcalf, 64 F.R.D. at 409 (holding that plaintiffs' attempts to define class were futile, therefore, they could not satisfy certification requirements). Therefore, we do not reach the parties' arguments concerning the enumerated requirements of rule 42(a) and (b)(4). Only with a properly defined class can the explicit class-certification provisions be examined appropriately. If, on remand, the trial court finds a suitable class definition, it must also ensure that the newly defined class complies with the requirements of rule 42(a) and (b).\",\n",

Texas Air Control Board (TAB), however, that subject matter jurisdiction challenges cannot be waived, and may be raised for the first time on appeal.[2] Because standing and ripeness are components of subject matter jurisdiction,[3] the court of appeals erred in failing to consider Waco Independent School District's jurisdictional challenge.

Under the policy, WISD administered the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) to first and second graders, and the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills Test (TAAS) to third through eighth graders. The policy mandates satisfactory performance on the test in addition to satisfactory performance in attendance and on the school curriculum. Students who do not meet WISD's standard on the test attend a thirty-day intense acceleration summer program based on the students' individual needs. At the program's end, students take released versions of the TAAS. Students who then meet WISD's standard will be promoted. If students still do not meet the standard, they can take an Assessment Credit by Examination test in reading and math. Students that pass this test are then promoted. Students are retained only after these efforts are unsuccessful.\",\n",

The suit alleges that minority students in the district will be harmed because they will fail the exams in disproportionate numbers and therefore be retained under the new policy. The Gibsons argue that retention will unfairly burden minority WISD students because it identifies and stigmatizes them as a \"failure.\" The suit also alleges that the policy violates the Equal Rights and Due Course *851 of Law provisions of the Texas Constitution,[6] violates confidentiality provisions of the Texas Education Code,[7] and was adopted in violation of the Open Records Act[8] and Open Meetings Act.[9] WISD alleged in its answer that the Gibsons do not have standing because they are suing on their own behalf, not as representatives of their children. WISD also asserted that the case is not ripe for adjudication because when the Gibsons sued, WISD had not released the results of the assessment tests and therefore had not retained any students.',\n",

Although WISD did not include its subject matter jurisdiction challenge in its motion, the record before the trial court is replete with the district's assertions that the Gibsons' claim was not ripe. After a hearing, the trial court granted WISD's motion on all of the Gibsons' claims except the alleged Open Meetings Act violation. The Gibsons then perfected this interlocutory appeal. WISD responded to the appeal by adding standing and ripeness challenges to its original assertion that the Gibsons failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before suing in district court.\",\n",
       "  'The court of appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the Gibsons proved their claims fell within exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies requirement, and that the trial court therefore had jurisdiction over the dispute.[11] The court of appeals, however, did not consider the merits of WISD\\'s standing and ripeness challenges because \"WISD failed to raise either of these issues in its motion to dismiss [the Gibsons\\'] suit,\" and because \"the court below neither expressly nor impliedly ruled on ripeness or standing.\"[12] Thus the court concluded that standing and ripeness were not properly preserved for its review. We disagree. We decided in TAB that because subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case, it cannot be waived and may be raised for the first time on appeal.[13] Thus, ripeness and standing components of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. Consequently, the court of appeals erred in failing to reach the merits of WISD\\'s jurisdictional complaint.',\n",
       "  'While WISD raises several challenges to the trial court\\'s jurisdiction, the ripeness issue is dispositive. In Patterson v. Planned Parenthood of Houston, we considered the parameters of the ripeness doctrine in Texas.[14] In Patterson, we noted that \"[r]ipeness, like standing, is a threshold issue that implicates subject matter jurisdiction, and like standing, emphasizes the need for a concrete injury for a justiciable claim to be presented.\"[15] While standing focuses on the issue of who may bring an action,[16] ripeness focuses on when that action may be brought.[17]',\n",
       "  'Under the ripeness doctrine, we consider whether, at the time a lawsuit is *852 filed, the facts are sufficiently developed \"so that an injury has occurred or is likely to occur, rather than being contingent or remote.\"[18] Thus the ripeness analysis focuses on whether the case involves \"uncertain or contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all.\"[19] By focusing on whether the plaintiff has a concrete injury, the ripeness doctrine allows courts to avoid premature adjudication, and serves the constitutional interests in prohibiting advisory opinions.[20] A case is not ripe when determining whether the plaintiff has a concrete injury depends on contingent or hypothetical facts, or upon events that have not yet come to pass.[21] Because that is the case here, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear this dispute.',\n",
       "  \"When this lawsuit was filed, no student in the WISD had been retained or given notice of retention under the challenged policy because the TAAS and ITBS test results were not yet available. The only notices that WISD sent out were notices of possible retention if the students did not meet all requirements for promotion. Thus, at the time this suit was filed, the alleged harm to the students caused by retention was still contingent on uncertain future events, i.e., the students' performance on the standardized tests and, if necessary, in WISD's remediation program. Moreover, the impact the Gibsons presumed was only hypothetical when the suit was filed; it may not occur as anticipated, or may not occur at all. There is simply no allegation that the Gibsons have suffered a concrete injury. Without a concrete injury from the WISD policy, the Gibsons have failed to show that the trial court had jurisdiction to decide this controversy.\",\n",
       "  'Although the Gibsons cannot show that a concrete injury has occurred, the ripeness analysis would allow them to demonstrate a concrete injury by showing that it is likely to occur.[22] It is mere speculation in this case, however, that the alleged injury is likely to occur. The United States Supreme Court has suggested that the threat of harm can constitute a concrete injury, but the threat must be \"direct and immediate\" rather than conjectural, hypothetical, or remote.[23] To show that such injuries are likely to occur, for example, parties must demonstrate that the harm is imminent, but has not yet impacted them. The potential harm in this case is not imminent; whether WISD students will be retained remains contingent upon their performance on the standardized tests, and, if necessary, their subsequent performance in WISD\\'s remediation efforts. Although it is well-documented that minority pass rates on the TAAS have been disproportionately lower than white students\\' pass rates, there was no evidence in this record that minorities will fail to be remediated in disproportionate numbers in WISD\\'s program. While WISD\\'s superintendent Roseanne Stripling, in answer to a question on cross-examination, stated that disproportionate numbers of minority students would be retained under the district\\'s \"policy,\" it is clear that she was referring to the results of the TAAS test, which all parties concede has a disproportionate impact, and not to the effort the district had adopted to remediate that problem.',\n",
       "  'The uncertainty of the policy\\'s impact is evident in statements made at the hearing on WISD\\'s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Responding to WISD\\'s assertion that the policy had not impacted any students when the Gibsons filed suit, the *853 trial judge summarized the Gibsons\\' argument as the \"impact\\'s coming,\" and \"[t]hey can feel it coming....\" The Gibsons\\' expert\\'s testimony is similarly telling. When asked if he had considered the impact of WISD\\'s policy, the expert cryptically responded, \"I cannot predict the future on that unless I know that the delivery systems are in order.\" These statements indicate that the concrete injury required by a ripeness inquiry has not developed here.',\n",
       "  'The procedural stance of this case arguably leaves the Gibsons without an opportunity to amend their pleadings or to demonstrate jurisdiction on a complete record, giving them only a \"sparse record\" with which to controvert WISD\\'s subject matter jurisdiction challenges. But we recognized in TAB that when an appellate court raises subject matter jurisdiction for the first time on appeal, litigants will not have an opportunity to cure defects.[24] As a safeguard then, we construe the petition in favor of the party asserting that the court has subject matter jurisdiction and review the entire record to ascertain if any evidence supports that assertion.[25] Having done so, the Court\\'s decision still turns on the fact that when the plaintiffs sued, no test results were available, and no evidence of the probability of the remediation program\\'s success or failure existed. With every available opportunity to generate record evidence opposing WISD\\'s challenges, the Gibsons could not have done so because the evidence required to do so did not exist. Indeed, that is exactly why the claim is not ripe. Accordingly, because their alleged injury remains contingent on the results of both the test and, if necessary, the remediation program, the Gibsons\\' claim is not ripe for review. We note that the Gibsons are not irrevocably harmed by this dismissal.

The only hearing held was on WISD's motion. With the case in this posture, we must determine ripeness and standing not only by construing the plaintiffs' original petition in their favor, and considering the evidence offered at the hearing on WISD's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but also by considering the possibility that the plaintiffs can amend their pleadings or offer evidence at a trial on the merits to show ripeness and standing.

One is that the retention policy will have a racially discriminatory impact in violation of equal rights and due course of law provisions of the Texas Constitution. The other is that retention will necessarily result in disclosure of test results (since it will be obvious that a child was not promoted) in violation of the privacy requirements of section 39.030(b) of the Texas Education Code.[7] (The plaintiffs' third *855 claim, that the retention policy was adopted in violation of the Open Meetings Act,[8] remains pending in the trial court).\",\n",

       "  \"The plaintiffs alleged in their original petition that in the prior year, nearly half the students in the grades to which the new retention policy would apply, had failed the standardized test they were given, and that the failure rates for white, Hispanic, and African-American students were 33%, 49%, and 57%, respectively. Taking these assertions as true, it is likely that some students will continue to fail the test in the future, and absent other efforts, that some disparity in pass rates among racial groups will persist. Thus, the Court is simply wrong when it concludes that WISD students' performance on the standardized tests is too contingent for the harm plaintiffs allege to be likely.\",\n",

The Court concludes that this assertion does not allege likely harm because it does not consider the potential success of remediation efforts for students who fail the tests. This conclusion is wrong for three reasons. First, it refuses to take the plaintiffs\\' pleadings as true. The Court simply disagrees with the plaintiffs\\' assertions of harm. Second, the Court\\'s conclusion ignores the fact that any child allowed to attempt remediation, such as by attending summer school, will be openly stigmatized as having failed the test, which the plaintiffs allege will violate the statutorily mandated confidentiality of test scores. A breach of confidentiality is part of the harm plaintiffs allege. Third, even assuming that plaintiffs must plead that remediation efforts will not avoid racially discriminatory retention, it fails to consider whether plaintiffs could do so.',\n",
       "  'The Court points to testimony by the plaintiffs\\' expert that he could not predict the future impact of the retention policy. There are three problems with this. First, the Court simply ignores other testimony by the same witness that based on his experience and test scores throughout the State, the policy would have a racially discriminatory effect. Second, the Court chooses to disregard testimony by WISD\\'s witness agreeing that more Hispanic and black students would be retained, and that \"this policy would have a disparate impact on the Hispanic and black community\". The WISD witness\\x97as the Court refuses to concede\\x97concluded that the policy, which includes the summer remediation program, would result in a disparate impact, that more minority students than white students would be retained as a result. Neither witness excluded the effect of the remediation policy from their respective conclusions. The Court nonetheless claims that \"there was no evidence in this record that minorities will fail to be remediated in disproportionate numbers in WISD\\'s program,\" discounting the concession *856 expressly made by WISD\\'s witness by drawing an adverse, and awkward, inference. This approach hardly amounts to a search for \"any evidence\" supporting jurisdiction.[10] Finally, the Court fails to acknowledge testimony and evidence showing that remediation efforts will be optional, limited, and often expensive: optional, in that students need not avail themselves of remediation; limited, in that WISD\\'s own hierarchy of preferences for placing students in its 30-day summer program contemplates the denial of that limited resource to those students it deems least likely to pass the TAAS requirement; and expensive, in that those who are denied or fail to gain promotion from the summer program must pay for the opportunity to take an examination for credit. For that matter, is not entirely clear that the summer remediation program will itself be free.

Never knowing that ripeness was an issue, since WISD never raised it, the plaintiffs offered no evidence on the issue. In this case, unlike TAB, jurisdiction cannot be determined on a full record.

       "  \"The parties tried the case to a jury. The jury found that Dr. Utts's and HCA's negligence proximately caused the Short family's damages. The jury found Dr. Utts twenty-five percent negligent and HCA seventy-five percent negligent. The jury awarded the Estate $100,000, Norma Short $300,000, and the three children *826 Dennie, Patricia, and Sam, $12,000 each. The Short family and the Estate moved for judgment on the verdict, allowing only a $10 per plaintiff settlement credit. Dr. Utts responded to the motion for judgment, objected to the $50 credit limitation, and requested a credit for the entire $200,000 HCA paid to Walker. In his response, Dr. Utts asserted that he was entitled to the entire $200,000 credit because the Short family benefited from Walker's settlement, and Walker's nonsuiting him was merely an attempt to circumvent how the statutory settlement credit should apply.\",\n",
       "  'The Short family, in response, argued that Walker was not a \"claimant\" as Chapter 33 defines that term; therefore, Dr. Utts was not entitled to a credit for Walker\\'s $200,000 settlement. They also argued that the factual claims and references to documents in Dr. Utts\\'s response to their motion for judgment were never offered into evidence during trial, were not part of the record, and were inadmissible hearsay.',\n",
       "  'Dr. Utts replied that Walker was a \"claimant\" under Chapter 33. He also filed a motion to reopen the evidence in the event the plaintiffs argued that the evidence about the settlement details that Dr. Utts intended to rely on during the motion-for-judgment hearing was untimely. Finally, Dr. Utts requested that the trial court take judicial notice of various pleadings and motions filed in the case.',\n",
       "  'During the hearing on the motion for judgment, the trial court took judicial notice of several documents in the trial court\\'s file, including the pleadings and Dr. Utts\\'s election for a settlement credit. Then, Dr. Utts attempted to offer several documents into evidence, but the Short family members objected. These documents included (1) correspondence between plaintiffs\\' counsel and HCA\\'s counsel about how Walker\\'s and the Short family members\\' settlement proceeds would be distributed; (2) a copy of the HCA $200,000 check made payable to a trust account of the plaintiffs\\' counsel; and (3) correspondence from Walker instructing the plaintiffs\\' counsel to give each Short family member $10,000 from the monies belonging to Walker in the firm\\'s trust account. The trial court allowed Dr. Utts to offer the documents and discuss their contents on the record, and it heard the Short family\\'s objections. Additionally, during the motion for judgment hearing, the Short family\\'s counsel stated that \"[Walker] got $200,000, and then she also executed the document giving me permission to put $150,000 into my trust account for fees and expenses which she was jointly and severally liable for.\" The trial court advised the parties that it would take all the matters at the hearing, including whether Dr. Utts\\'s evidence was admissible, under advisement.',\n",
       "  'Following the hearing, the trial court notified the parties in a letter that it could not consider Dr. Utts\\'s post-verdict evidence and that Dr. Utts waived his right to a $200,000 credit because he did not introduce the evidence about the settlement before submission to the jury. The trial court\\'s letter also stated that Walker was not a \"claimant\" under Chapter 33, because the statute\\'s definition of that term requires that the claimant be a party seeking recovery when the trial and verdict occurred. The trial court sent with the letter its final judgment, which reflected the amounts the jury awarded, less a $10 credit ($50 total) for the Estate\\'s and each family member\\'s settlement with HCA.',\n",
       "  \"Dr. Utts then filed several formal bills of exception, identifying the evidence the trial court heard but refused to admit during the hearing on the motion for judgment. The trial court next signed an order that *827 overruled Dr. Utts's objection to the Short family's motion for judgment, denied his motion to reopen the evidence, and granted his request to take judicial notice of the pleadings and motions.\",\n",
       "  'Dr. Utts timely appealed and raised three issues: (1) whether he met his burden to prove a settlement by introducing evidence after a verdict was reached; (2) whether he was statutorily entitled to a settlement credit for the Walker settlement, or whether the multiple claimants could structure a settlement to avoid his right to a credit; and (3) whether a dollarfor-dollar credit for a lump-sum settlement with multiple claimants should be subtracted from the total damages the jury awards, rather than allocated based on each claimant\\'s percentage of recovery from the total verdict. 987 S.W.2d at 629. In deciding Dr. Utts\\'s second issue, the court of appeals concluded that although Walker was a \"claimant\" under Chapter 33, Dr. Utts was not automatically entitled to apply a credit for Walker\\'s settlement against the other Short family members\\' recoveries. The court of appeals held that one claimant\\'s settlement cannot be applied against a different claimant\\'s recovery under Chapter 33. 987 S.W.2d at 630.

Second, Dr. Utts argues that the term \"claimant\" is not limited to those derivative plaintiffs remaining in the suit at the time the trial court submits the case to the jury.

Accordingly, we do not apply Drilex to determine which settlement amounts Dr. Utts may credit against the Short family members' recoveries.\",\n",
       "  'However, a majority of the Court agrees that we must consider Dr. Utts\\' contention that he is entitled to full credit for Walker\\'s settlement with HCA because the transaction\\'s structure allowed the Short family members to avoid the statutory settlement credit. The court of appeals rejected that argument. It noted that Dr. Utts did not attempt to present evidence in the trial court to support his allegation that the settlement was a \"sham\" until after the jury returned its verdict. 987 S.W.2d at 631. The court of appeals opined that Dr. Utts knew how the Walker settlement was distributed well before the trial court submitted the case to the jury; therefore, Dr. Utts could have offered evidence about the Walker settlement, even in the face of a motion in limine, by presenting the evidence to the trial court outside *828 the jury\\'s presence. 987 S.W.2d at 632.',\n",
       "  \"The court of appeals also observed that Dr. Utts took no countermeasures to protect himself from the potentially adverse consequences of Walker's settlement with HCA. The court of appeals noted that Dr. Utts did not attempt to keep Walker in the suit for a jury submission, he did not request the trial court to structure the jury submission in a way that would permit establishing a fraud or sham claim, and he did nothing to preserve a potential claim against HCA. 987 S.W.2d at 632.\",\n",
       "  \"Dr. Utts concedes that, before the case was submitted to the jury, he did not offer the evidence demonstrating the settlement's nature nor did he request a factfinding that the settlement was a sham. Dr. Utts did request the trial court, after the verdict, to reopen the evidence to allow him to demonstrate the nature of the settlement. Although the trial court denied this request, Dr. Utts does not challenge that ruling here. Instead, he argues that it is not his burden to prove the transaction's nature. Dr. Utts asserts several reasons why placing the burden on him is improper: (1) he is a stranger to this transaction; (2) the Short family's attorney is an officer of the court and has a fiduciary responsibility to show the transaction's fairness; (3) one who claims a gift has the burden to prove that such is the fact; and (4) imposing the burden upon the nonsettling defendant to prove the settlement's nature not only unfairly penalizes the nonsettling defendant, but also allows settling parties to circumvent the one-satisfaction rule. Finally, Dr. Utts contends that even if he has the burden to prove how the settlement actually worked, the evidence in the record is enough to demonstrate the transaction's spuriousness.\",\n",

       "  'Dr. Utts\\' allegation that the Walker-HCA settlement is a \"sham\" transaction is actually a claim that, to *829 avoid the Short family members benefiting from the Walker-HCA settlement in contravention of Chapter 33\\'s settlement-credit scheme, he is entitled to a credit for the settlement under Chapter 33. We disagree with the court of appeals\\' analysis about how Dr. Utts should have raised this issue in the trial court. In Ellender, we were not confronted with the issue that we consider here. But Ellender\\'s Chapter 33 analysis provides guidance. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927-28. A defendant must file an election for a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit before the case is submitted to the jury, and the record must reflect that credit amount. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 33.014; Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927. But when a case involves facts suggesting that a nonsettling plaintiff may have benefited from the proceeds of another plaintiff\\'s settlement, the nonsettling defendant must raise this allegation to the trial court\\x97not the jury\\x97and present evidence of the benefit as part of its burden in electing for a dollar-for-dollar credit. The nonsettling defendant may present this evidence to the trial court outside the jury\\'s presence and request that the trial court resolve its settlement-credit claim before the trial court submits the case to the jury. Indeed, the nonsettling defendant may consider the trial court\\'s settlement-credit ruling critical to its election decision. Thus, the trial court should resolve the issue before it submits the case if the nonsettling defendant so requests. However, the nonsettling defendant may also urge its settlement-credit motion and introduce evidence thereon after the jury has returned its verdict, provided the nonsettling defendant properly filed a written election under Chapter 33 before the case was submitted. A nonsettling defendant\\'s allegation that nonsettling plaintiffs benefited from another plaintiff\\'s settlement must be resolved in this manner because the trial court, not the jury, determines how a settlement credit applies as part of the trial court\\'s function when it determines the judgment to render based on the jury\\'s verdict. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 928-29.',\n",
       "  \"Accordingly, we hold that, when a nonsettling defendant contends it is entitled to a credit because a nonsettling plaintiff benefited from another plaintiff's settlement proceeds, the nonsettling defendant must file a written election before the trial court submits the case to the jury and ensure the settlement amount is in the record, just as it would in any other Chapter 33 case. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 33.014; Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927. Then, through pre- or post-verdict discovery, the nonsettling defendant must present evidence to the trial court that demonstrates the nonsettling plaintiff benefited from the settlement the nonsettling defendant relies on. If the evidence shows such a benefit, then the trial court should apply the settlement credit reflecting that benefit unless the nonsettling plaintiff presents evidence that he or she did not benefit from the settlement. In other words, once the nonsettling defendant presents evidence of the nonsettling plaintiff's benefit from a settlement, the trial court shall presume the settlement credit applies unless the nonsettling plaintiff presents evidence to overcome this presumption. As we recognized in Ellender, a nonsettling party should not be penalized for events over which it has no control. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927. Like the Ellender plaintiffs who were in the best position to demonstrate how they agreed to allocate settlement amounts for punitive and actual damages, the nonsettling plaintiffs in the circumstances here are in the best position to demonstrate why they did not benefit from the settlement. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 928.\",\n",
       "  \"*830 Here, the record indicates that Dr. Utts filed a written election for $200,040 before the trial court submitted the case to the jury. Moreover, the settlement agreements between Walker and HCA and the Short family members and HCA are in the record. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927. Furthermore, Dr. Utts properly raised his claim that he may be entitled to credit Walker's settlement with HCA against the Short family members' jury awards. In his response to the Short family's motion for judgment, he alleged that the Short family members who did recover from Dr. Utts benefited from the Walker settlement.\",\n",
       "  \"Moreover, during the motion for judgment hearing, and in his formal bills of exception, Dr. Utts offered the types of evidence a nonsettling defendant may rely on to establish that a nonsettling plaintiff benefited from another plaintiff's settlement. The settlement between Walker and HCA, the $200,000 check from HCA made payable to the trust account of the plaintiffs' firm, Walker's letter instructing plaintiffs' counsel to distribute a total of $40,000 from that trust account to the individual Short family members, and the settlement agreement between the Short family members and HCA for nominal amounts all demonstrate that the Short family members benefited from Walker's settlement with HCA. Further, plaintiffs' counsel made statements before the trial court and the court of appeals suggesting that $150,000 from the Walker-HCA settlement went to the plaintiffs' attorneys for fees and costs. Nothing in the record shows whether Walker actually received $50,000 as the settlement agreement states, or whether she only received $10,000. Therefore, we conclude that the record evidence and counsel's statements together raise a presumption that Dr. Utts may be entitled to a credit for $190,000 of the settlement amount. Consequently, we presume that each individual Short family member's recovery from Dr. Utts should be credited with the amount reflecting the benefit he or she received from the settlement proceeds. See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 927. The burden thus shifts to each Short family member to present evidence showing why the settlement credit should not apply. To avoid the credit, each member must demonstrate that he or she did not benefit from the Walker-HCA settlement agreement.\",\n",

       "  'In Drilex, we professed to follow section 33.011(1)\\'s plain language to conclude that \"claimant\" under section 33.012(b) means all family members suing for damages arising from another family member\\'s injury or death. But, in doing so, we did not adhere to our statutory-construction rule that we must not construe statutes in a way that would lead to an absurd result. C & H Nationwide, Inc. v. Thompson, 903 S.W.2d 315, 322 n. 5 (Tex.1994). In section 33.011(1), the Legislature defined \"claimant\" in the first sentence as \"a party seeking recovery of damages pursuant to the provisions of section 33.001 [the proportionate-responsibility statute].\" However, instead of applying that definition in Drilex, we relied on section 33.011(1)\\'s second sentence to define claimant. Drilex, 1 S.W.3d at 122. The second sentence explains that, when someone sues because he or she has suffered a loss caused by another person\\'s injury or death, \"claimant includes both that other person and the party seeking recovery of damages pursuant to the provisions of section 33.001.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & REM.CODE § 33.011(1).

       "  'However, reading Chapter 33 as a whole and under well-established Texas law, it is evident that the Legislature did not intend for section 33.011(1)\\'s second sentence to provide a separate definition of \"claimant.\" Rather, the second sentence ensures that, when a suit involves derivative claims, the derivative plaintiff cannot recover if the injured or deceased person\\'s negligence is greater than fifty percent. See Tex. Civ. *833 Prac. § Rem.Code §§ 33.001, 33.011(1). Further, the second sentence ensures that, if the injured or deceased person\\'s negligence does not bar the claim, the derivative plaintiff\\'s recovery is reduced by a percentage equal to the injured or deceased person\\'s percentage of responsibility. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 33.012(a).',\n",

Therefore, the injured or deceased person's contributory negligence, if more than fifty percent, precludes a derivative plaintiff's recovery. See Reagan, 804 S.W.2d at 467. On the other hand, if the injured or deceased person's contributory negligence is less than fifty percent, then the trial court must reduce the derivative claimant's jury award by the injured or deceased person's contributory negligence. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 33.012(a). Then, if the derivative plaintiff settles his or her derivative claims, which reflect his or her personal injuries, the trial court should credit those amounts to any jury award the derivative plaintiff receives against nonsettling defendants.

However, contrary to what we said in Drilex, we did not, in General Chemical Corp., \"construe\" or \"conclude\" anything about section 41.001(1)\\'s meaning. See Drilex, 1 S.W.3d at 122. Rather, we only acknowledged, and then rejected, the court of appeals\\' reliance on that provision. General Chem. Corp., 852 S.W.2d at 923-24.',\n",
       "  \"Second, in Drilex, we cited J.D. Abrams, 966 S.W.2d at 96, to support our conclusion that the entire Flores family comprised one claimant. See Drilex, 1 S.W.3d at 122. In J.D. Abrams, McIver and her daughter, Lori Crane, sued several defendants to recover damages for Crane's injuries arising *834 from a car accident. J.D. Abrams, 966 S.W.2d at 96. Three defendants settled, and the trial court allocated part of two settlements to McIver and the entire third settlement to Crane. J.D. Abrams, 966 S.W.2d at 96. The jury awarded Crane, but not McIver, damages against the nonsettling defendant who was adjudged jointly and severally liable. The trial court credited the amounts Crane received from the settling defendants against her damage award. J.D. Abrams, 966 S.W.2d at 96. But the court of appeals held that the trial court should have granted the nonsettling defendant credit for the full amount the trial court allocated to Crane and McIver from all the settlements. J.D. Abrams, 966 S.W.2d at 96.\",\n",
       "  'But the court in J.D. Abrams, and this Court in Drilex, ignored the fundamental flaw with defining \"claimant\" as multiple persons for purposes of applying settlement credits under section 33.012(b). That is, treating the entire family as one claimant\\x97particularly when family members receive individual settlements in different amounts for their distinct losses\\x97 does not comport with Texas law which recognizes that derivative plaintiffs are asserting separate claims for their own losses caused by another person\\'s injury or death. See Reagan, 804 S.W.2d at 467; Whittlesey, 572 S.W.2d at 668. No language in section 33.011 or section 33.012 suggests that the Legislature intended to group all derivative plaintiffs together as one claimant so that one derivative plaintiff\\'s settlement wipes out another derivative plaintiffs\\' claims.',\n",
       "  \"Indeed, Drilex's results demonstrate why our Chapter 33 analysis was wrong and leads to results inconsistent with Texas law. See C & H Nationwide, Inc., 903 S.W.2d at 322 n. 5. Because we concluded that the entire Flores family was one claimant under section 33.012(b), we determined that the total damages the Flores family recovered had to be reduced by the total settlements the family received. Drilex, 1 S.W.3d at 122. After reducing the total jury award by Jorge Flores' contributory negligence, and then subtracting the total settlements from the reduced jury award, we allocated the remaining amount among the family members according to their respective percentages of the total jury award. Drilex, 1 S.W.3d at 123. Accordingly, the children, Jorge, and Maria each individually received some, but not all, of the amounts the jury awarded them. Our Drilex Chapter 33 analysis, therefore, permitted the Flores children to recover a part of their jury awards contrary to the one-satisfaction rule. Because each child settled for more than what the jury awarded him or her, each child's settlement should have eliminated their individual jury awards. Moreover, because we included the Flores children when we reallocated the reduced jury award, our analysis resulted in Jorge and Maria recovering less than what they should have from their jury awards.\",\n",
       "  \"Had Drilex applied what I now believe is the correct Chapter 33 analysis, we would have affirmed the court of appeals' calculations. See Drilex Sys., Inc. v. Flores, 961 S.W.2d 209, 214-15 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1996), aff'd as reformed and remanded, Drilex, 1 S.W.3d at 124. Specifically, the court of appeals concluded that the three Flores children's individual settlements eliminated their individual jury awards, because they each settled for more than they recovered after trial. Jorge and Maria settled for a lump sum, and Jorge also settled individually. Both settlements were for less than Jorge and Maria recovered individually from the jury. Consequently, Jorge's and Maria's individual jury awards were reduced by 10% for Jorge's contributory negligence. Then, the court of appeals determined *835 Jorge's and Maria's percentage of recovery from the jury verdict, which was 95% for Jorge and 5% for Maria, and applied the same percentage of recovery from the lump-sum settlement. After crediting Jorge's and Maria's individual jury awards with their individual percentage of recovery to the lump-sum settlement, and after crediting Jorge's individual jury award with his individual settlement, the court of appeals awarded the reduced jury award to Jorge and Maria. See Drilex, 961 S.W.2d at 214-15.\",\n",
       "  \"It is evident, then, that my analysis carries out Chapter 33's purposes so that a derivative plaintiff's recovery is either (1) barred by the injured or deceased party's contributory negligence if greater than fifty percent, or (2) reduced by the injured or deceased party's contributory negligence if less than fifty percent and by any settlement amounts the derivative plaintiff receives. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code §§ 31.001, 31.011(1), 31.012(a),(b). Moreover, my construction does not belie the one-satisfaction rule or Texas law recognizing derivative plaintiffs are asserting separate claims for their own losses, tangible and intangible, caused by injury to another person. See Crown Life Ins. Co., 22 S.W.3d at 390; Stewart Title Guar. Co., 822 S.W.2d at 8; Reagan, 804 S.W.2d at 467; Whittlesey, 572 S.W.2d at 668.\",\n",
       "  'The dissent contends that Drilex\\'s holding that claimant means the entire family for settlement credit purposes is in harmony with our wrongful death statute. 81 S.W.3d at 843 (Owen, J., dissenting). But section 71.010 actually supports my position that \"claimant\" under section 33.012(b) refers only to each individual derivative plaintiff just as section 33.011(1)\\'s first sentence provides. Section 71.010 provides that \"[t]he jury may award damages in an amount proportionate to the injury resulting from the death\" and that \"[t]he damages awarded shall be divided, in shares as found by the jury in its verdict, among the individuals who are entitled to recover and who are alive at that time.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 71.010(a), (b). This language shows that each derivative plaintiff suffers a distinct, apportionable injury because of a family member\\'s death. Notably, neither section 71.010 nor any other law supports the dissent\\'s contention that, when a defendant elects a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit, a jury may determine how much a settling plaintiff would have recovered had he or she remained in the suit. See 81 S.W.3d at 844 (Owen, J., dissenting).',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the dissent and Dr. Utts contend that overruling Drilex and J.D. Abrams is contrary to our recent statement that the stare decisis doctrine prevents changing a statutory interpretation even if that long-standing judicial interpretation was incorrect. See Grapevine Excavation, Inc. v. Maryland Lloyds, 35 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tex.2000). And they urge that stare decisis exhorts us to \"adhere to our precedents for reasons of efficiency, fairness and legitimacy.\" See Weiner v. Wasson, 900 S.W.2d 316, 320 (Tex.1995). The dissent and Dr. Utts also emphasize that the Legislature has met twice since J.D. Abrams issued and once since Drilex issued and has not amended the relevant Code provisions. They contend we should apply the legislative-acceptance doctrine in interpreting Chapter 33 and thus adhere to Drilex.',\n",
       "  'I agree that this Court should adhere to stare decisis and should not, without very good cause, change our previous statutory interpretation. However, this case is readily distinguishable from Grapevine, in which twenty years of precedent from this Court and courts of appeals constrained us to interpret a statute a particular way. See Grapevine, 35 S.W.3d at 5. Drilex is *836 only slightly over two years old, and while the Legislature has met once since we decided Drilex, Dr. Utts\\'s motion for rehearing was pending during that entire session. And, in any event, the Legislature has not amended or reenacted Chapter 33 or sections 33.011(1) and 33.012 since J.D. Abrams and Drilex issued. Therefore, we are not confronted with the fact that the public or the legal community has become accustomed to the law under these cases. Nor are we confronted with the presumption that the Legislature has acquiesced in Drilex\\'s Chapter 33 analysis. See Grapevine, 35 S.W.3d at 5 (\"It is a firmly established statutory construction rule that once appellate courts construe a statute and the Legislature re-enacts or codifies that statute without substantial change, we presume that the Legislature has adopted the judicial interpretation.\").',\n",
       "  'The dissent\\'s accusation that my Chapter 33 analysis \"advocates complete disregard for the Legislature\\'s will\" is unfounded. See 81 S.W.3d at 838 (Owen, J., dissenting). Rather, I believe this Court strayed from the Legislature\\'s intent when we first construed Chapter 33 in Drilex and read language into section 33.011(1) that the Legislature did not write. I do not disagree with the dissent\\'s position that the Legislature, in enacting Chapter 33, had the authority to change common law. See 81 S.W.3d at 839 (Owen, J., dissenting). But when we construe a statute, we presume that the Legislature acted with knowledge of the common law and court decisions. Phillips v. Beaber, 995 S.W.2d 655, 658 (Tex.1999). My Chapter 33 analysis adheres to this statutory-construction principle.',\n",
       "  'In sum, Drilex\\'s troubling effect is that a settlement with any one derivative plaintiff can deprive all other possible derivative plaintiffs of their full recovery for their independent injuries when they did not receive any proceeds from the settlement. Accordingly, to apply Chapter 33 in a manner that is consistent with its purposes and our law, the Court should overrule Drilex to the extent that it concludes that \"claimant,\" for purposes of applying settlement credits under section 33.012(b), means all family members suing for damages arising from another family member\\'s injury or death.',\n",

       "  'Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code creates a scheme for apportioning tort liability among parties and for determining the effect of settlements on a claimant\\'s right to recover tort damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code §§ 33.001-33.016. The statute defines \"claimant\" as \"a party seeking recovery of damages ...\" Id. § 33.011. Because this language is written in the present tense, I believe that a plaintiff who settles or otherwise withdraws from a lawsuit is not a party seeking recovery of damages. Thus, Mrs. Walker ceased to be a claimant after she settled with HCA and non-suited her action against Dr. Utts.',\n",
       "  'Dr. Utts contends that despite the nonsuit, he should be allowed to off-set the damages awarded by the jury to Mrs. Walker\\'s mother and siblings by the amount of her settlement because Mrs. Walker was a claimant when she settled with HCA. The statute, however, apparently assumes not only that a claimant is a party seeking damages but also that the claimant will recover damages, because *837 settlement credits are to be deducted from the claimant\\'s award. Id. § 33.012(b). Specifically, if a claimant has settled with one or more persons, the settlements may be applied in one of two ways to \"reduce the amount of damages to be recovered by the claimant with respect to a cause of action.\" Id. A party who withdraws from a case and abandons her cause of action cannot recover damages and cannot receive an award that is capable of reduction by a settlement credit.',\n",
       "  'Justice Owen criticizes this application of the statute, suggesting that it reads into the definition of \"claimant\" limitations the Legislature did not intend. She points out that the definitions both of \"defendant\" and \"settling person\" include a temporal limitation, \"at the time of submission\", that is absent from the definition of \"claimant.\" See id. § 33.011(1), (2), (5). She further notes that the Legislature defined \"settling person\" to mean only a settling defendant, not a settling plaintiff, at the time of submission. See id. § 33.011(5). It may be significant that the Legislature did not include a settling plaintiff, or for that matter a former claimant, but perhaps not for the reasons Justice Owen offers.',\n",
       "  'Under this statute, the trier of fact is to determine as to each cause of action the percentage of responsibility of the following persons: (1) each claimant; (2) each defendant; (3) each settling person; and (4) each responsible third party who has been joined under section 33.004. Id. § 33.003. A defendant who settles remains in the lawsuit as a settling person whose percentage of responsibility must be submitted. The Legislature decided, probably for purposes of making the settlement credit election, that the transformation from defendant to settling person had to occur on or before the submission of the case. On the other hand, no election is necessary when a plaintiff has settled or otherwise abandoned his or her cause of action. Nor is there any reason to submit a plaintiff who has abandoned his or her cause of action, unless there is a claim that the former plaintiff contributed to cause another\\'s injury. In short, the temporal limitations in the definitions of \"defendant\" and \"settling person\" are required for purposes of the settlement credit election. They need not be read to transform the meaning of \"claimant\" from \"a party seeking recovery of damages\" to a \"former party\" who \"had sought\" the recovery of damages. See id. § 33.011.',\n",
       "  'Justice Owen and Justice Baker disagree over whether we correctly applied this statute in Drilex Systems, Inc. v. Flores, 1 S.W.3d 112 (Tex. 1999). Justice Baker argues that we misconstrued the statute\\'s definition of \"claimant\" in Drilex and that the decision should be overruled. Justice Owen argues that Drilex correctly construes the statute, and she applies it to these facts. Under my view, the facts in this case are distinguishable from Drilex. Because the term \"claimant\" does not include a former plaintiff who has withdrawn from the lawsuit, we need not revisit Drilex here. Nor is it necessary to overrule Drilex to decide this case. I must concede, however, that any of the readings offered by the Court\\'s opinions today are plausible. I hope the Legislature will consider the policy implications raised by Justice Owen and Justice Baker and clarify the intent of the law.',\n",
       "  \"Finally, I consider Dr. Utts' contention that Mrs. Walker's settlement was actually for the benefit of all claimants and that her position as the sole recipient of the settlement was merely a sham. I agree that the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the settlement proceeds in this case are sufficient to raise an issue regarding the legitimacy of the transaction.

After issuing opinions, granting rehearing (twice), withdrawing the original opinions, and issuing new ones, a majority of the Court is still unable to agree on what \"the claimant\" means in Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code when family members sue as derivative plaintiffs to recover for the injury or death of another family member and one or more settle and withdraw from the suit before trial. There are three different views presently held by Members of this Court (a fourth view, which was expressed in Justice Hankinson\\'s concurring opinion in our prior array of decisions in this case, has been abandoned on rehearing),[1] with no view garnering the support of a majority. In light of today\\'s \"resolution\" of this case, we can only hope that the Legislature will act promptly to say with unmistakable clarity how settlement credits are to be applied in cases such as this.',\n",
       "  'There is at least a consensus of a majority of the Court on one point: Drilex Systems, Inc. v. Flores[2] remains good law when family members settle but remain parties pursuing claims against a non-settling defendant. I agree with the concurring opinion of Chief Justice Phillips to the extent that it concludes that Drilex remains authoritative and has not been overruled. I part company with that concurring opinion and Justice Baker\\'s concurring opinion because neither correctly interprets what the Legislature meant when it used the term \"the claimant\" in Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code when one family member settles and withdraws from the case, but other family members continue to sue.',\n",
       "  'The concurring opinion of Chief Justice Phillips would eliminate settlement credits for payments to a settling family member if he or she non-suited all claims before the case was submitted to the jury, even though the definition of \"the claimant\" in section 33.001 does not support this construction. Indeed, the Legislature explicitly included the words \"at the time of submission\" in other definitions in section 33.011, but not in the definition of \"claimant.\"',\n",
       "  'Justice Baker\\'s concurring opinion sweeps stare decisis aside in advocating that we overrule Drilex, decided less than three years ago. Justice Baker\\'s opinion also advocates complete disregard of the Legislature\\'s will in several respects. That concurring opinion would only give effect to the Legislature\\'s express definition of \"the claimant\" when those words are used in subsection 33.012(a), but not when they are used in subsection (b).[3] Nor would Justice Baker\\'s concurring opinion give effect to the Legislature\\'s directive in subsection 33.012(b)(1) that a non-settling defendant must be given credit for \"the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements\" if it so elects.[4] Non-settling defendants would receive only partial credit *839 under Justice Baker\\'s analysis. Justice Baker\\'s opinion asserts that rewriting the statute is justified because judge-made law should be paramount over the Legislature\\'s directives. Justice Baker\\'s concurring opinion concludes that to read the Legislature\\'s enactment as written would lead to \"absurd results,\" not because the results are truly absurd, but because judge-made common law might be changed. As I explain in greater detail below, the common-law one-satisfaction principle remains intact under the Legislature\\'s settlement credit scheme because \"the claimant,\" which is the family unit, recovers only what the jury awarded it collectively, less all settlements. But even were the one-satisfaction rule impacted, that would not be a basis for refusing to give full effect to a statute. Within constitutional confines, the Legislature is free to change the common law if it so chooses.',\n",
       "  'I would give effect to the language chosen by the Legislature. In section 33.012, \"the claimant\" must be construed to include all those who claim damages for the injury or death of another person as well as that injured or deceased person. Section 33.012(b) requires that any recovery by \"the claimant\" must be reduced by a settlement with one or more family members, regardless of when they settle. The family members are, however, entitled to have the jury determine the amount of damages that should be apportioned to each, whether they have settled or not. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this case for a new trial so that a jury can determine the amount of damages sustained by Dorothy Short Walker, her mother, siblings, and her father\\'s estate, and the settlement dollars paid to Walker can be credited in the same manner as the Court did in Drilex.',\n",

Before trial, one of the Shorts' children, Dorothy Short Walker, settled with HCA for $200,000. The other five plaintiffs settled with HCA for ten dollars ($10.00) each. Walker non-suited her claims against Utts, but Clifton Short's estate and the other Short family members did not.\",\n",

The record reflects that the entire $200,000 was paid into the law firm\\'s trust account, but there is correspondence in which Walker directed an attorney with that firm to distribute $10,000 each to her mother and her three siblings from \"any monies belonging to me that he or his firm may have in his possession.\" Walker\\'s counsel stated on the record in the trial court that Walker executed a document permitting him \"to put $150,000 into my trust account\" to pay litigation fees and expenses for which Walker was jointly and severally liable.

Based on the express definition of the \"claimant,\" each family member is joined with the injured or deceased person, and accordingly, each is in turn joined with other relatives for purposes of the definition of \"claimant.\" Chapter 33 treats the injured or deceased person as the hub when claims are made for his or her injury or death. There can be one or more spokes emanating from that hub. These spokes are the derivative claims of a spouse, child, or parent of the injured or deceased person. But each spoke is part of the whole.

Her mother, Joyce McIver, sued in her individual capacity and as the guardian of Crane\\'s estate.[23] Prior to trial, settlements were reached with several defendants, totaling $2,497,175.[24] The jury subsequently awarded Crane $13,500,000, but no damage issue was submitted to the jury for her mother\\'s individual claims.[25] The trial court allowed a settlement credit of only $1,782,881.20, the aggregate amount of the settlements it had allocated to Crane.[26] The court of appeals reversed, holding that the full amount of the settlements, including the amounts paid to McIver for her individual claims, must be applied to reduce the judgment in favor of Crane.[27] The court of appeals concluded that under section 33.012, \"claimant\" included both McIver, who was a derivative plaintiff, and Crane, the injured person.[28] The court in McIver rejected the argument that is now made by the Short family in this case:',\n",
       "  'Crane also contends that this result would make her give a credit for money she never received, money that by court order went to another person, McIver, for McIver\\'s own losses. While that is true, we believe the legislature intended this result in order to protect defendants from plaintiffs who would manipulate settlements among those \"seek(ing) recovery of damages for injury to another person.\"[29]',\n",
       "  'In Drilex, we, too, rejected the argument that settlements paid to a family member should not be deducted from the recovery by other family members. In approving the analysis in J.D. Abrams v. McIver, a unanimous Court reiterated that \"the claimant\" as used in sections 33.011 and 33.012 meant \"the entire family\":',\n",
       "  \"As noted by the First Court of Appeals in McIver, a claimant's recovery is reduced only by the amount of settlement money already received by that claimant. *843 McIver, 966 S.W.2d at 96-97. In this case, the entire family is treated as one claimant; therefore, all of the settlement money must be deducted from the family's recovery. If, however, there were another claimant (for example, a second injured employee), that claimant's settlements would not be deducted from the Flores family's recovery, and similarly, the Flores family's settlement would not affect the other claimant's recovery.[30]\",\n",
       "  'In Drilex, we were fully apprised that the statute\\'s plain language might lead to seeming inequities. We observed, \"some plaintiffs may recover more than the amount awarded by the jury, and some plaintiffs\\' awards will be reduced by settlement amounts paid to other plaintiffs.\"[31] We nevertheless recognized our obligation to apply the statute as written, not as we might have written it if we were the Legislature: \"Although such results may seem harsh, they are mandated by the statutory language and are consistent with legislative intent.\"[32]',\n",
       "  'Although we observed in Drilex that \"harsh results\" might occur under section 33.012, we did not have occasion to consider in any detail whether inequities might occur in applying the settlement credit provisions when some but not all family members settle. Now that the Court is presented with a case in which one of several family members has settled and withdrawn from the suit, we have been given the benefit of more focus on the particular question of how \"the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements\" is to \"reduce the amount of damages to be recovered by the claimant.\"[33] On examining the statute with this question in mind, it appears that \"harsh results\" are not likely in cases like this one. A reasonable construction of section 33.012 is that it permits non-settling family members to obtain jury findings as to the damages to be apportioned to each family member, including those who have settled. The total settlement amounts are then deducted from the damages awarded to \"the claimant,\" not just from the damages awarded to non-settling members of \"the claimant.\"',\n",
       "  'The words \"the claimant\" as used in Chapter 33, mean \"the claimant\" for all purposes. When one family member settles, it is a settlement by \"the claimant\" even if only that one family member receives payment. That is because, as discussed above, section 33.011(1) defines \"claimant\" to include a party seeking damages for the death of or injury to another person together with the person who has been injured or killed.[34] If others are also seeking damages for the death of or injury to the same person, they are linked through that injured or deceased person to all who have derivative claims. By the same token, when section 33.012(b) says with regard to settlements that \"the court shall further reduce the amount of damages to be recovered by the claimant,\" \"the amount of damages to be recovered by the claimant\" includes a settling family member even though the settlement may bar that individual from actually receiving what the jury awards.',\n",
       "  'This is in harmony with how the wrongful death statutes view derivative claims of *844 family members. The wrongful death statutes treat all family members\\' injuries resulting from the death of another family member as a single injury, with damages divided by the jury into \"shares\" among the individual beneficiaries:',\n",
       "  '(a) The jury may award damages in an amount proportionate to the injury resulting from the death.',\n",
       "  '(b) The damages awarded shall be divided, in shares as found by the jury in its verdict, among the individuals who are entitled to recover and who are alive at that time.[35]',\n",
       "  'As we explained more than fifty years ago, each individual wrongful death beneficiary has the right to recover damages proportionate to his or her injury, but there is but one sum to be recovered and divided among them in a single action:',\n",
       "  'The statute gives the right of action to all the persons within the classes named to recover one sum. That sum must be apportioned among those persons according to their several rights, but under the statute there can be but one action.[36]',\n",
       "  'In determining \"an amount proportionate to the injury resulting from the death,\"[37] a jury should be able to consider all the beneficiaries, even those who have settled, if dollar-for-dollar settlement credits have been claimed by a non-settling defendant. The fact that a settlement may preclude a beneficiary from actually receiving the amount awarded by the jury should not affect what the jury is to decide under the wrongful death statutes and under section 33.012(b), which is the total injury resulting to all statutory beneficiaries. Any settlement amounts should be deducted from the total award to all family members, and the remaining recovery should be allocated to non-settling family members based on the percentage that the jury award to each bears to the total amount found by the jury as damages suffered by the non-settling plaintiffs. An example of the mathematical calculation is included in Appendix A.',\n",
       "  'The Short plaintiffs argue that in some cases, family members are hostile towards one another and a settling family member may not be inclined to cooperate with the remaining plaintiffs in proving the settling person\\'s damages. While this may be true in some instances, that is not a basis for construing \"the claimant\" to mean something other than what the Legislature has said it means. Moreover, defendants face similar difficulties in cases in which they ask the jury to determine the percentage of responsibility of a \"settling person\" (i.e., a settling defendant) or a \"responsible third party\" under section 33.003.[38]',\n",
       "  'In this case, the Short plaintiffs should be entitled to ask a jury to divide the amount it finds to be \"proportionate to the injury resulting from the death\"[39] of Clifton Short into shares among each of the beneficiaries, including Dorothy Walker. From the total amount of damages awarded to the widow and children of Clifton Short, Utts should be entitled to a settlement credit for all settlement amounts, which in this case would be $200,050, because that is what section 33.012 requires. \"If the claimant has settled with one or more persons, the court shall further reduce the amount of damages to be recovered by the claimant ... by a credit equal *845 to ... the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements.\"[40] I would hold that the trial court erred in refusing to give Utts credit for the full amount of the settlement paid to Dorothy Walker, and that the court of appeals\\' judgment affirming the trial court must be reversed. Although the Short plaintiffs did not ask the trial court to submit the question of Dorothy Walker\\'s damages to the jury, in the interest of justice, I would further hold that the Short plaintiffs are entitled to a new trial to have that determination made if they so choose.[41]',\n",

The Court was asked on rehearing in Drilex to reconsider the settlement credits issues among others, and we did so for almost one year. The Court then withdrew its original opinion, but in the substituted opinion, the section dealing with settlement credits and how \"claimant\" must be construed remained unchanged. We construed the statutes as their text requires: \"under the plain language of section 33.011(1), the term `claimant\\' in section 33.012(b)(1) includes all of the family members.\"[48] We continued, \"[b]ecause we must view the entire Flores family as one claimant for section 33.012(b)(1) purposes, the total of all damages to be recovered by the family must be reduced by the total of all settlements received by the family.\"[49]',\n",

The second is that a majority of the Court in our original decisions in Utts reaffirmed Drilex,[58] as we do today. The first Utts opinions were issued in January 2000, prior to the commencement of the 2001 legislative session. Although, as noted above, a majority of the Court could not agree on how sections 33.011 and 33.012 were to be construed and applied to facts that differed from Drilex, a majority confirmed that Drilex governs how settlement credits are to be applied when a settling plaintiff remains a party to the case. Although the motion for rehearing in Utts was outstanding when the 2001 legislative session ended (we granted the motion for rehearing on June 7, 2001, ten days after the end of the session), before, during, and at the close of the last legislative session, Drilex had authoritatively construed \"the claimant\" as used in sections 33.011 and 33.012 to mean \"all of the family members\"[59] when they all remain parties to the suit while pointedly noting that harsh results *848 may occur under the statutes.[60] The only issue left open in our original Utts opinions was how Chapter 33 was to be construed when one plaintiff settles before trial, a situation different from that in Drilex.',\n",

The Court says that the determination of whether a payment by one family member to another is a sham can be determined after the jury's verdict, which is reasonable and will be necessary in some cases. But, the Court does not also say that if the trial court concludes that the payment was not a sham, then the defendant must be able to change its election to the percentages set forth in 33.012(b)(2) if it chooses to do so. The Court's silence should not be taken for anything other than its unwillingness to address the issue. The Court's opinion should not be interpreted as depriving a non-settling defendant of a meaningful choice that has been given by the Legislature.\",\n",

The Secretary of State asserts that in a 1983 election law opinion, the Secretary of State determined that state election law prevails over conflicting provisions of city charters. Since the Election Code became effective in 1986, the Secretary of State's interpretation of the forty-five-day filing deadline has been that it prevents home-rule cities from adopting their own application deadlines. The Secretary of State asserts that this interpretation was sent to the Justice Department in a 1985 letter stating:\",\n",

This distinction is significant because that same letter provides that section 143.005 \"authorizes a home-rule city by charter to prescribe requirements for a candidate\\'s application for a place on the ballot for a city office....\" Thus, the Secretary of State made clear to the Justice Department in 1985 that home-rule cities could prescribe their own requirements for a candidate\\'s application for a place on the ballot in municipal elections. And under Election Code section 143.005, those \"requirements\" include filing deadlines.

Therefore, a carrier that has neither initiated benefits nor filed a notice of refusal has not complied with the statutory requisite, and has failed to trigger the sixty-day period to investigate or deny compensability.',\n",
       "  'It is also clear that by mandating that carriers either initiate benefits as required by the Act or send a notice of refusal within the short seven-day deadline, the Legislature intended to provide employees with a prompt response to their benefit claims and to streamline the process to avoid early attorney involvement. See 1 MONTFORD ET AL., A GUIDE TO TEXAS WORKERS\\' COMP REFORM 5-52 (1991) (\"Section [409.021] significantly accelerates the `processing time\\' for carriers either to initiate benefit payments ... or to contest compensability. Promptness of the initial comp payment was considered an important reform objective since delays in initiating benefits under the prior law at times resulted in hardship upon the employee and a need ... for early attorney involvement.\"). The Legislature further sought to encourage carriers to initiate benefit payments by providing an unfettered basis to deny compensability for up to sixty days if benefits are initiated, but limiting a carrier who refuses to pay to the ground specified in a notice of refusal, unless the carrier discovers new evidence it could not reasonably have discovered earlier. See Tex. Lab.Code § 409.022(b); see also id. §§ 409.022(c) (stating that carrier commits administrative violation if it \"does not have reasonable grounds for a refusal to pay benefits\"), 415.002(18) (stating that carrier commits administrative violation if it \"controverts a claim if the evidence clearly indicates liability\"). Thus, interpreting the legislative scheme to require carriers to comply with the seven-day deadline to trigger the sixty-day period to investigate or deny compensability gives meaning to all the provisions of both sections 409.021 and 409.022, and strikes a balance between the injured employee\\'s interest in obtaining prompt payment of benefits or notice of refusal and the carrier\\'s interest in investigating valid grounds for refusal.',\n",
       "  'Continental\\'s construction, by contrast, renders meaningless: (1) the seven-day deadline of section 409.021(a); (2) the incentive of unlimited bases for denial of compensability for carriers who initiate payments as provided in the second sentence of section 409.021(c); and (3) all the limitations regarding notices of refusal in section 409.022. That construction would permit carriers to do nothing, thereby delaying benefits and eliminating the statutory *807 requirement of early notice of denial that gives employees certain protections, and permit carriers to take up to sixty days to investigate without paying benefits or risking being bound by an earlier ground for refusal. Although the parties and the court of appeals label the consequence for failure to meet the seven-day pay-or-dispute deadline a \"waiver,\" that is not precisely what happens under the statutory scheme. We are presented not with a question of waiver, but of a deadline (seven days to pay or dispute), and a consequence for failing to meet that deadline (a carrier that does nothing fails to avail itself of the sixty-day period to investigate or deny compensability). Both the deadline and the consequence are clearly chosen and clearly expressed by the Legislature.',\n",

Yet Continental was apparently not penalized in this case, and it has not cited any instance in which any carrier has been penalized for violating section 409.021(a). Nor has the Texas Workers\\' Compensation Commission as amicus curiae represented that it does or has in fact penalized carriers for failing to comply with the seven-day deadline. The administrative penalty Continental claims is a sufficient incentive is itself discretionary. Tex. Lab.Code § 415.021 (\"The commission may assess an administrative penalty against a person who commits an administrative violation.\"). The fact that the Commission has the discretion to impose an administrative penalty does not make the Legislature\\'s language imposing the seven-day rule any less mandatory, or the consequences of violating the rule any less clear.',\n",

At that rate, the penalty for just one claim, assessed over a fifty-three-day period, would exceed $250,000.

The trial court rendered judgment on the jury's negligence verdict for Apodaca, and the court of appeals affirmed. 51 S.W.3d 686. In this cause, Excel challenges, among other things, whether legally sufficient evidence exists to support the jury's finding that Excel's negligence proximately caused Apodaca's injuries. We conclude that no evidence supports that finding, and accordingly reverse the court of appeals' judgment and render judgment that Apodaca take nothing.\",\n",
       "  'Apodaca began working at Excel in 1978. He held a number of physically demanding positions before sustaining injuries to his neck, back, and wrist that ultimately resulted in his being unable to return to work in 1995. During his last three years at Excel, Apodaca worked as a cryovac 8300 operator. As a cryovac 8300 operator, Apodaca handled bags of meat weighing up to forty pounds, which were moved by a conveyor belt to a table located near him. As bags landed on the table, Apodaca would bend to grab a bag, turn towards the cryovac machine, and slide the bag onto a machine plate. The cryovac machine then removed air from the bag and sealed it. During a typical eight-hour shift, Apodaca sealed one bag approximately every three seconds.',\n",
       "  \"On May 2, 1995, Apodaca completed an Employee Statement of Injury, reporting pain in his left hand. He visited several physicians for treatment. While Apodaca's doctors determined he had injured his back, neck, and wrist, the only injury they agreed was work related was the carpal tunnel syndrome in his wrist. Accordingly, Excel paid for medical expenses related to the carpal tunnel injury. An orthopedic surgeon treated the carpal tunnel injury by splinting Apodaca's hand. On August 3, 1995, an electromyography revealed that the carpal tunnel syndrome had resolved. At this point, Excel stopped paying Apodaca's medical expenses. Nonetheless, Apodaca eventually underwent three operations to treat his neck, lower back, and wrist. Despite feeling better after these surgeries, Apodaca continued to suffer pain and could no longer work or perform household duties, such as mowing the lawn or washing dishes.\",\n",
       "  \"Because Excel is a nonsubscriber under the Workers' Compensation Act, Apodaca sued Excel alleging common-law claims of negligence and gross negligence in failing to provide a safe workplace. See Tex. Lab.Code § 406.033(d); Werner v. Colwell, 909 S.W.2d 866, 868 (Tex.1995). Apodaca specifically alleged that the machinery and design of the cryovac operator's workplace required excessive bending, reaching, and pulling, without appropriate rest periods, and that Excel's untimely detection of his CTD symptoms aggravated his injuries and delayed treatment for them. The jury found Excel negligent and awarded actual damages of $536,472. The trial court rendered judgment on the verdict.\",\n",

With respect to the evidence of proximate cause, the court concluded, among other things, that \"the evidence on cause in fact is not particularly strong,\" but that \"the jury could have found that the speed of the production line, which workers were discouraged from slowing or stopping, was excessive and the number of repetitions the employee was required to perform because of the speed and without an opportunity to rest was the cause of [Apodaca\\'s] CTDs.\" Id. at 699.

       "  'On petition for review, Excel challenges, among other things, the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\\'s finding that Excel\\'s negligence proximately caused Apodaca\\'s injuries. Proximate cause comprises two elements: cause in fact and foreseeability. Doe v. Boys Clubs of Greater Dallas, Inc., 907 S.W.2d 472, 477 (Tex.1995). Foreseeability means that a person of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger his or her negligence creates. El Chico Corp. v. Poole, 732 S.W.2d 306, 313 (Tex.1987). The test for cause in fact, or \"but for cause,\" is whether the act or omission was a substantial factor in causing the injury \"without which the harm would not have occurred.\" Boys Clubs, 907 S.W.2d at 477. A finding of cause in fact cannot be supported by \"mere conjecture, guess, or speculation,\" id., but may be based on either direct or circumstantial evidence. Havner v.

In determining whether Apodaca presented legally sufficient evidence to meet that test, we view the evidence in a light that tends to support the finding of the disputed facts and disregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary. See Bradford v. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 754 (Tex. 2001).',\n",
       "  'Apodaca presented several different categories of evidence to show that his injuries were caused or exacerbated by Excel\\'s failure to provide a safe workplace, including: (1) testimony from Excel employees about recommended or requested changes to the cryovac worksite and about recommended ergonomics and medical-management programs; (2) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommendations about changes to the cryovac worksite and the use of symptoms surveys; and (3) medical testimony linking Apodaca\\'s injuries to his job. Before this Court, although he mentions other evidence, Apodaca highlights the testimony of James Rudd, a safety and ergonomics coordinator at Excel: \"Mr. Rudd\\'s testimony, standing alone, is certainly sufficient for purposes of a `no evidence\\' challenge to support the jury\\'s finding that but for Excel\\'s negligence, [Apodaca] would not have suffered his injuries.\" Accordingly, we begin by reviewing Rudd\\'s testimony in detail.',\n",
       "  \"Rudd worked for Excel for eleven years, first on the production line and then later as an ergonomic and safety monitor and coordinator. Among his job responsibilities was to set up training programs about CTDs for Excel employees. He testified that he trained employees to understand their role in Excel's ergonomics program, recognize potential contributors to and risk factors for CTDs, learn ways to control risk factors, and encourage early reporting and treatment of CTDs. Rudd testified that in his experience, Excel employees were exposed to the risks that contribute to CTDs, and that cryovac operators specifically were exposed to such risks.\",\n",
       "  \"Identifying CTD symptoms early was especially important for purposes of intervention. Excel's training manual, The Ergonomics Manual, also emphasized early identification, stating that a primary ergonomic goal was to treat health problems *821 early and avoid surgery or more other complex medical treatments. To meet this goal, Excel's manual Introduction to Ergonomics recommended adoption of a medical-management program to screen employees for early stages of disorders and employ conservative treatment. The Ergonomics Manual suggested that medicalmanagement programs use formal questionnaires and surveys to gather information about employees who suffered from CTD symptoms. From 1991 through 1997, Excel performed these medical-management surveys annually. Early identification of CTD symptoms is critical, Rudd explained, because all CTDs are completely reversible if treated early with conservative treatment.\",\n",
       "  'OSHA recommended annual use of a symptoms-survey checklist in its manual, Ergonomic Program Management Guidelines for Meatpacking Plants. Rudd agreed that annual surveys are beneficial. Conducted anonymously to encourage employee participation, these surveys aid in identifying the areas of a worksite or the jobs where potential CTD problems exist. A major strength of the survey approach is the ability to collect data on the number of workers who may be experiencing some form of CTD. Excel used symptoms surveys in 1991, but did not do so in 1992, 1993, and 1994. It reintroduced the surveys in 1995, after Apodaca sustained his injuries.',\n",
       "  \"OSHA further recommended and Excel employees had requested that Excel install a photo eye on the cryovac machine, which it did not do. There was testimony that a photo eye would have better regulated the flow of production by detecting bags of meat on the conveyor belt and stopping and starting accordingly. Excel also did not implement OSHA recommendations that cryovac operators reach no more than sixteen to eighteen inches and bend no further than six to ten degrees in order to reduce deviated postures and extended reaches, which contribute to CTDs. Apodaca and other Excel employees, including a former safety director, chief union steward for Apodaca's floor, and Apodaca's supervisor, testified to the difficulties and risks presented by the cryovac operator environment and job requirements. Apodaca also presented testimony from three treating physicians, who agreed that at least his wrist problems were work related.\",\n",
       "  'From this evidence, Apodaca argues that had Excel followed recommendations to modify the cryovac work environment and had it conducted symptoms surveys, he would not have been injured, his injuries would not have been as severe, or his injuries would have been detected earlier and could have been reversed with conservative treatment instead of developing to the point that surgery was required. But we have reviewed the record in its entirety and can find no evidence that symptoms surveys, conducted anonymously to identify worksite problems, would have identified Apodaca\\'s CTD injuries earlier, thereby allowing CTD reversal through conservative treatment. Nor is there any evidence that modifications to the cryovac work environment would have reduced the number of injuries or the CTD incident rate for Apodaca\\'s job. No evidence in the record indicates that had Apodaca performed fewer repetitions per hour, worked at a more comfortable work station, or had a photo eye on his machine, he would not have sustained his injuries. Furthermore, the fact that the meatpacking industry, or even just the cryovac operator position, had a high injury rate is not probative evidence of whether under different conditions, the cryovac operator job would have a lower injury rate. If anything, much of Apodaca\\'s evidence fulfills only the foreseeability element of proximate cause by demonstrating the *822 dangerous nature of the cryovac operator position. See El Chico, 732 S.W.2d at 313 (explaining that the foreseeability element means that \"the actor as a person of ordinary intelligence should have anticipated the dangers his negligent act creates for others\").',\n",
       "  \"The evidence cited by Apodaca and relied on by the court of appeals all suffers from the same essential defect: while the evidence may show that Excel should have employed other practices and that Apodaca's injuries were work related, none of it shows that had Excel employed those other practices, Apodaca would not have been injured. See Boys Clubs, 907 S.W.2d at 477. In other words, the evidence does not show that had Excel modified the cryovac worksite or job requirements, or had it conducted symptoms surveys, Apodaca would not have suffered his injuries or they would have been diagnosed sooner and reversed using other treatments.\",\n",
       "  'The medical evidence suffers from the same infirmity. The doctors agreed that at least part of Apodaca\\'s injuries, specifically his wrist injury, was work related. Two doctors testified that the motions demanded by Apodaca\\'s work environment caused carpal tunnel syndrome to develop in Apodaca\\'s wrist; another stated that he believed all of Apodaca\\'s injuries were caused by his job. But no doctor linked those injuries to anything Excel did or failed to do. While the evidence supports the conclusion that at least some of Apodaca\\'s injuries were work related, it fails to establish that Apodaca would not have been injured but for any negligent conduct by Excel. See Boys Clubs, 907 S.W.2d at 477. Thus, we agree with the dissenting justice in the court of appeals that whether Apodaca would have suffered CTD injuries in the absence of Excel\\'s negligent acts or omissions \"was left to the speculation of the jury.\" 51 S.W.3d at 704. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence that Excel\\'s negligence was the cause in fact of Apodaca\\'s injuries.',\n",

After purchasing her food but before leaving the snack bar, Reece slipped and fell in a puddle of clear liquid. The puddle was about the size of a small- or medium-sized pizza and was to the side of the usual line snack-bar customers followed. Reece injured her right knee and underwent surgery to repair a ligament tear.',\n",

Cloyd had walked away from the counter and was about five to eight feet from Reece when she slipped and fell. He testified that only then did he notice the liquid on the floor. The store manager acknowledged that the self-service drink and ice machines increased the risk of spills in the snack-bar area.

A slipand-fall plaintiff satisfies the notice element by establishing that (1) the defendant placed the substance on the floor, (2) the defendant actually knew that the substance was on the floor, or (3) it is more likely than not that the condition existed long enough to give the premises owner a reasonable opportunity to discover it. See Gonzalez, 968 S.W.2d at 936; Keetch, 845 S.W.2d at 265.

       "  \"Wal-Mart, on the other hand, contends that Reece's position is inconsistent with fundamental premises-liability concepts. According to Wal-Mart, an employee's proximity to a hazard cannot, by itself, impute constructive notice because such a rule would not afford premises owners a fair opportunity to inspect and correct, or warn about, the condition. Wal-Mart claims that mere proof an employee might have discovered the condition by being close to it misstates the plaintiff's burden and requires premises owners to be omniscient. *815 Such a rule, Wal-Mart argues, imposes constructive notice the instant a hazard is created, whether or not there was a reasonable opportunity to discover it, thus violating the principle that premises owners are not insurers of their invitees' safety.\",\n",

Similarly, if an employee was in close proximity to a less conspicuous hazard for a continuous and significant period of time, that too could affect the jury's consideration of whether the premises owner should have become aware of the dangerous condition. But in either case, there must be some proof of how long the hazard was there before liability can be imposed on the premises owner for failing to discover and rectify, or warn of, the dangerous condition.

Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Reece, we hold that there is no evidence to support the conclusion that Wal-Mart had constructive notice of the dangerous condition. See Bradford v. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 754 (Tex.2001).',\n",

First, the court noted Wal-Mart\\'s acknowledgment that the selfserve drink machine increased the likelihood of spills in the snack-bar. 32 S.W.3d at 344. Second, the court cited Wal-Mart\\'s store policy that required employees to keep their assigned areas free from hazards and to intervene if \"they walk[ed] past ... a known hazard\" anywhere in the store. Id. But this evidence is immaterial to the constructive-notice issue. It is undisputed that Cloyd did not notice the hazard that he purportedly walked past; thus, the hazard was not known and the store\\'s policy was not implicated. Moreover, assuming the fairly obvious fact that spills are more likely to occur in a selfserve beverage area, that does not relieve Reece of her burden to prove the required premises-liability elements.',\n",

See Gonzalez, 968 S.W.2d at 936 (applying the constructive-notice rule when the plaintiff relied on circumstantial evidence). But this argument begs the question, and again would result in strict liability whenever there is employee proximity to a hazard. Reece asked the jury to infer that because Cloyd was in close proximity to the spill right before the accident occurred, Wal-Mart had a reasonable opportunity to discover it. See Russell v. Russell, 865 S.W.2d 929, 933 (Tex.1993) (observing that circumstantial evidence establishes a fact when the fact may be \"inferred from other facts proved in the case\" (quoting Dallas County Flood Control v.

Gracia supervised as some of the boys jogged on the track, while others played tag. At one point, several nonresident boys, who had been playing soccer on an adjacent field, approached Gracia and the boys and proposed that they all play a game of football. Gracia allowed his boys to play on the condition that tackling would take place only below the waist. Gil-Perez participated in the football game, which continued for a few hours. On the last play, he was tackled and suffered a dislocated knee.',\n",

The trial court rejected Southwest Key\\'s argument and submitted the case to the jury as one involving ordinary negligence.

Alternatively, Southwest Key argued that the jury's verdict was not supported by legally or factually sufficient evidence that its breach proximately caused Gil-Perez's injury. Specifically, Southwest Key asserted that Gil-Perez's sole liability theory was based on Southwest Key's failure to provide protective equipment during the game, but there was no evidence that this failure proximately caused Gil-Perez's injury. Gil-Perez countered that he raised other theories of liability, including negligent supervision and negligent instruction and organization of the game.\",\n",

       "  'A. Liability Standards',\n",
       "  'Although this Court has not spoken on the issue of liability in the context of sports injuries, the lower courts of this state and the high courts of many other states have. Three models of liability have emerged. A majority of courts have adopted a \"reckless or intentional\" standard in a variety of sports-related situations, requiring an injured plaintiff to prove that the participant-defendant\\'s conduct was either reckless or intentionally injurious.[1] And some courts have extended this standard to situations in which the defendant is a nonparticipant in the sporting event, as the court of appeals determined Southwest Key to be here. See Morgan v. State, 90 N.Y.2d 471, 662 N.Y.S.2d 421, 685 N.E.2d 202, 207-08 (1997) (holding that, in assessing whether an owner or operator of an athletic facility has violated a duty of care toward voluntary participants injured on the premises, the applicable standard should include whether the conditions caused by the defendant\\'s negligence were unique and created a dangerous condition over and above the usual dangers inherent in the sport); Kline v. OID Assocs., 80 Ohio App.3d 393, 609 N.E.2d 564, 565 (1992) (applying the reckless or intentional standard when an injured indoor soccer game participant sued the owner of the facility in which the game was played as well as the organizer of the soccer league). However, a few states adhere to the traditional negligence standard, under which a defendant owes a duty of ordinary care. See Estes v. Tripson, *272 188 Ariz. 93, 932 P.2d 1364, 1366 (App.1997); Auckenthaler v. Grundmeyer, 110 Nev. 682, 877 P.2d 1039, 1043-44 (1994); Lestina v. W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co., 176 Wis. 2d 901, 501 N.W.2d 28, 32-33 (1993). Finally, there is the \"inherent risk\" standard, previously advocated by some Members of this Court, which states that both co-participant and nonparticipant defendants owe no duty to protect a participant from risks inherent in the sport or activity in which he has chosen to take part. Phi Delta Theta Co. v. Moore, 10 S.W.3d 658, 663 (Tex.1999) (Enoch, J., dissenting to improvident grant); see also West v. Sundown Little League of Stockton, Inc., 96 Cal. App. 4th 351, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 849, 854-55 (2002) (applying the inherent risk standard in a suit by an injured little league player against local and national little league organization and coaches); Davis v. Greer, 940 S.W.2d 582, 582-83 (Tex.1996) (Gonzales, J., opinion on denial of application for writ of error) (arguing that the inherent risk standard is preferable to the reckless or intentional standard); Scott v. Pac. W. Mountain Resort, 119 Wash.2d 484, 834 P.2d 6, 13-14 (1992) (\"A defendant simply does not have a duty to protect a sports participant from dangers which are an inherent and normal part of a sport.\").',\n",

He contends that Gracia breached this duty by \"negligent[ly] organiz[ing] and supervisi[ng] ... th[e] game of tackle football without proper equipment\" when \"more reasonable alternatives such as soccer or touch football\" existed. (Emphasis added.) Alternatively, Gil-Perez argues that the tackle football game need not have been played at all. Although Gil-Perez contends that other non-negligent options\\x97such as touch football or not playing football at all\\x97were available, that has no bearing on whether Gracia\\'s decision to allow the boys to play tackle football proximately caused Gil-Perez\\'s injury. The fact that a defendant could have chosen not to do an allegedly negligent act or could have chosen to do some other act\\x97which would undoubtedly be true in every negligence case\\x97is irrelevant to whether the allegedly negligent act actually caused the plaintiff\\'s injury. Here, it appears clear that the crux of all of Gil-Perez\\'s \"theories\" of negligence is that but for the lack of protective equipment, he would not have been injured. In fact, in his brief to this Court, Gil-Perez states that his \"primary allegation\" is that Southwest Key was negligent in \"setting up and playing a game of tackle football when no equipment was available.\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the brief reiterates that Gil-Perez\\'s \"theory remains that a reasonable supervisor of minors should not and would not organize a game of ... tackle football without the safety gear and football equipment necessary to make such a game reasonably safe.\" (Emphasis added.)

In reaching its verdict, the jury made notations in the margin next to each of the five elements of damage. These notations totaled $500,000, which was the amount of the verdict. On appeal, the defendant challenged the verdict, arguing that there was no evidence to support the amounts noted by the jury on two of the five elements. We rejected the argument, observing that the jury\\'s margin notations were not in legal effect \"separate damage awards for purposes of evidentiary review.\" Thomas, 895 S.W.2d at 359. We further said that because the defendant had not asked for separate damage findings, it could only challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the whole verdict. Id. at 360. Because the defendant did not make this argument, we rejected its evidentiary challenge. Id.',\n",

Harris County pointed out to the trial court that particular elements of damage had no support in the evidence and should not be included in the broad-form question.

The court then concluded that the erroneous inclusion of an invalid element of damage was harmless, even when identified by timely objection, so long as there was sufficient evidence of other elements in the broad-form question on which the jury could have reached its verdict. 66 S.W.3d at 336-38.',\n",

Harris County directs our attention to two courts of appeals' decisions that, contrary to the court below, apply Casteel's reasoning to broadform damage questions. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Casteel, 22 S.W.3d at 389. The same year we decided Lancaster, we applied its reasoning to a similar situation involving a broad-form damages question. See Eastern Tex. Elec. Co. v. Baker, 254 S.W. 933, 934-35 (Tex.1923). In Eastern Texas Electric, the trial court submitted a single broad damage issue and instructed the jury to consider past and future mental and physical pain in awarding damages even though there was no evidence of future physical pain. The court of appeals held that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury to consider future pain but concluded that the error was harmless because evidence of past mental and physical pain was sufficient to support the award. This Court reversed, concluding that the harmless error standard \"was not intended to deprive a party to a suit of a substantial right,\" namely, \"the right to have the damages assessed against it by the jury under proper instructions submitting only the elements of damage as raised by the pleadings, and supported by evidence.\" Id. at 934.

Ed. 2d 371 (1991), and hold the charge error in this case to be harmless. In Griffin, the Court considered whether a charge in a criminal case, allowing the jury to find guilt under either of two counts, only one of which had support in the evidence, violated the due process clause. The Court held it did not, following over a century of criminal jurisprudence. Id. at 49-51. Griffin did not make any new criminal law, nor did it purport to extend its view of constitutional requirements to civil procedure. The dissent here acknowledges as much, but nevertheless suggests that Griffin's logic should apply equally in state civil procedural questions as in federal constitutional law. 96 S.W.3d at 233 (O'Neill, J. dissenting). But the United States Supreme Court itself has acknowledged that a different reversible error analysis applies in civil cases. See Maryland v. Baldwin, 112 U.S. 490, 493, 5 S. Ct. 278, 28 L.

The second is an error which \"probably prevented the petitioner from properly presenting the case to the appellate courts.\" Tex.R.App. P. 61.1(b). Focusing only on the first condition, the dissent suggests that we must presume harm here in order to reverse. We disagree. Just as in Casteel, the trial court\\'s charge error in this case caused actual harm because it prevented Harris County from properly presenting its case to the appellate courts. Tex.R.App. P. 61.1(b). In this regard, the case is no different from Casteel.',\n",

Here, of course, we have actual error in the charge, not an imagined or potential one. More importantly, our decision is not a change in recommended broad-form practice. Comments to the Texas Pattern Jury Charges have long recommended that damage elements should be submitted separately \"if there is substantial doubt as to whether there is evidence to support\" an element.

       "  'Neither our decision today nor Casteel is a retrenchment from our fundamental commitment to broad-form submission. This Court began moving toward modern broad-form practice in 1973, when we amended Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 277 to abolish the requirement that issues be submitted separately and distinctly, thereby granting trial courts the discretion to submit issues broadly. Over the years, we have repeatedly expressed our general preference for broad-form submission. See Hyundai Motor Co. v. Rodriguez, 995 S.W.2d 661, 663-64 (Tex.1999); Texas Dep\\'t of Human Servs. v. E.B., 802 S.W.2d 647, 649 (Tex.1990); Lemos v. Montez, 680 S.W.2d 798, 801 (Tex.1984). Our current rule, amended in 1988, more strongly reflects our preference for broad-form questions, mandating that the \"court shall, whenever feasible, submit the cause on broad-form questions.\" Tex.R. Civ. P. 277.',\n",
       "  'When properly utilized, broad-form submission can simplify charge conferences and provide more comprehensible questions for the jury. See Hyundai Motor, 995 S.W.2d at 664. But we recognize that it is not always practicable to submit every issue in a case broadly. As Professors Muldrow and Underwood observe, \"broader is not always better.\" Muldrow & Underwood, Application of the Harmless Error Standard to Errors in the Charge, 48 Baylor L.Rev. 815, 853 (1996). For example, we have suggested that broad-form submission may not be feasible when the governing law is unsettled. See Westgate, Ltd. v. State, 843 S.W.2d 448, 455 n. 6 (Tex.1992). In such an instance, submitting alternative liability standards permits the appellate court to settle the law and *236 render the correct judgment. Similarly, it would be contrary to judicial economy to insist on broad-form submission when a specific objection raises substantial concern that a particular theory of liability will infect the proposed broad-form question with error. See Casteel, 22 S.W.3d at 390. And in a case such as this one, asking the jury to record its verdict as to each element of damages when there is doubt as to the legal sufficiency of the evidence will permit the losing party to preserve error without complicating the charge or the jury\\'s deliberations. See Texas Pattern Jury Charges\\x97General Negligence PJC 8.2 cmt.; see also Muldrow & Underwood, supra, at 855.',\n",
       "  \"Whether a granulated or broad-form charge is submitted, the trial court's duty is to submit only those questions, instructions, and definitions raised by the pleadings and the evidence. See Elbaor v. Smith, 845 S.W.2d 240, 243 (Tex.1992); see also TEX.R. CIV. P. 278. But using the harmless error rule to permit the indiscriminate mixture of valid and invalid liability theories or damage elements, without recourse, undermines a party's incentive to request legally correct definitions, instructions, and questions. In fact, it has been suggested that harmful error analysis like that by the court of appeals here rewards the party who invited the charge error in the first place:\",\n",
       "  \"[T]he trial court's submission of a defective charge can actually become a winning proposition. A party can safely request a legally defective charge provided that proper theories of liability are broadly submitted with improper theories or proper elements of damage are broadly submitted with improper elements. The jury might find in the requesting party's favor based entirely on the improper theory of liability or element of damage. Yet, as long as the jury could have found in that party's favor based on a proper theory or element, the appellate court will affirm. The party who invited error would be rewarded for doing so.\",\n",

       "  'A litigant should not be powerless to require the trial court to fulfill its duty of submitting only those questions and instructions having support in the pleadings and evidence. A timely objection, plainly informing the court that a specific element of damages should not be included in a broad-form question because there is no evidence to support its submission, therefore preserves the error for appellate review. See 34 Hodges & Guy, Texas Practice: The Jury Charge In Texas Civil Litigation § 40, at 38-39 (2d ed. supp. 2001) (discussing appellate review of errors masked by broad-form submission and urging that timely objection to the charge should preserve error for review); see also State Dep\\'t of Highways v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 241 (Tex.1992) (test for preservation is whether \"party made the trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and obtained a ruling\").

He testified that his pain was severe, and his doctor testified that even after corrective surgery he would be unable to sit for more than short periods of time. The jury awarded him $90,000. Harris County does not contend that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the total amount of the plaintiffs' damages. Nevertheless, because one unsupported damage element was included in each plaintiff's broad-form jury charge, the Court presumes reversible harm. See 96 S.W.3d at 234. To do so the Court must assume, contrary to longstanding precedent, that the jury failed to follow the trial court's instructions.

       "  'Even apart from the charge\\'s specific language in this case, the Court\\'s analysis glosses over a distinction that is critical in determining an erroneous submission\\'s harmful effect. Generally, a jury question can be erroneous for two reasons: (1) it fails to conform to the substantive law, and thus submits an invalid legal theory; or (2) it contains a valid legal theory, but there is no evidence to support its submission to the jury. In Crown Life Insurance Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 388 (Tex.2000), we confronted the former situation. There, the broad-form jury question commingled fourteen liability theories, four of which could not provide a basis for recovery because the plaintiff was not a consumer under the DTPA. 22 S.W.3d at 386-87. We noted that the jury \"was given no indication that Casteel was required to be a consumer to succeed under any of [the liability theories],\" and held that a single broad-form liability question that erroneously commingles valid and invalid liability theories is harmful \"when it cannot be determined whether the improperly submitted theories formed the sole basis for the jury\\'s finding.\" Id. at 389. Our decision was based on the notion that \"[i]t is fundamental to our system of justice that parties have the right to be judged by a jury properly instructed in the law.\" Id. at 388. Thus, we determined it \"essential that the theories submitted be authorized and supported by the law governing the case.\" Id. at 389.

Garcia, 893 S.W.2d 504, 529 (Tex.1995).

Rather than presume harm because the broad-form damage questions included an unsupported element, I would apply a traditional harmless error analysis. Because there was ample evidence to support the jury's damage award under the properly submitted damage elements, I would affirm the trial court's judgment. Because the Court holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\"],\n",

After Bennett withdrew from the partnership, Cochran sued Bennett, alleging negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and breach of contract. Bennett counter-sued, asserting, inter alia, claims for breach of contract and battery. The jury awarded Bennett $29,000 in damages ($24,000 for Cochran's breach of contract and $5,000 resulting from Cochran's battery) and $50,000 in attorney's fees. The jury also awarded Cochran $50,000 in damages based on Bennett's negligent misrepresentations. The trial court granted Cochran's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and ordered that Bennett take nothing.\",\n",

The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that, because Bennett requested only a partial reporter's record, he waived any complaint challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. 92 S.W.3d 8. Pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 34.6, when an appellant requests only a partial reporter's record, the\",\n",
       "  \"appellate court must presume that the partial reporter's record ... constitutes the entire record for purposes of reviewing the [appellant's] stated points or issues. This presumption applies even if the statement includes a point or issue complaining of the legal or factual insufficiency of the evidence to support a specific factual finding identified in that point or issue.\",\n",
       "  \"Tex.R.App. P. 34.6(c)(1), (4). The rule expressly states that an appellant need not file a complete reporter's record to preserve legal or factual sufficiency points. Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in holding that Bennett waived his legal and factual sufficiency points of error by filing an incomplete reporter's record.\",\n",
       "  'Although the court of appeals did not address the issue, Cochran alleges alternatively that Bennett waived his legal and factual sufficiency challenges by failing to comply with Rule 34.6(c)(1)\\'s requirement *229 to \"include in the request [for a partial reporter\\'s record] a statement of the points or issues to be presented on appeal.\" Tex.R.App. P. 34.6(c)(1). Cochran does not allege that Bennett\\'s delay prejudiced Cochran on appeal. Instead, he contends that, because Bennett failed to timely file a statement of his points or issues, he is not entitled to the presumption that the partial reporter\\'s record constitutes the entire record for purposes of reviewing his legal and factual sufficiency challenges.',\n",
       "  'Although Bennett\\'s statement of issues was due \"[a]t or before the time for perfecting the appeal,\" he filed it almost two months late. Tex.R.App. P. 34.6(b)(1). However, nothing in the record indicates that Bennett\\'s tardiness impaired Cochran\\'s appellate posture. Cochran had more than two months after he first received notice of Bennett\\'s statement of issues to file his appellee\\'s brief. Cochran does not contend that Bennett\\'s delay prevented him from identifying the relevant issues or supplementing the reporter\\'s record. Nor does Cochran assert that he had insufficient time to adequately prepare his appellate arguments.',\n",
       "  'There is no question that, had Bennett completely failed to submit his statement of points or issues, Rule 34.6 would require the appellate court to affirm the trial court\\'s judgment. See Richards v. Schion, 969 S.W.2d 131, 133 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (\"When an appellant appeals with a partial reporter\\'s record but does not provide the list of points as required by rule 34.6(c)(1), it creates the presumption that the omitted portions support the trial court\\'s findings.\"). Many of our courts of appeals require \"strict compliance\" with all of Rule 34.6\\'s provisions to preserve appellate review. See, e.g., Brown v. McGuyer Homebuilders, Inc., 58 S.W.3d 172, 175 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th. Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (appellant\\'s failure to file statement of points in compliance with Rule 34.6 required appellate court to presume record\\'s omitted portions supported trial court\\'s judgment); In re R.C., 45 S.W.3d 146, 149 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2000, no pet.) (appellate court permitted to review only those issues properly designated in appellant\\'s statement of points); Hilton v. Hillman Distrib. Co., 12 S.W.3d 846, 847 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2000, no pet.) (requiring both request for partial record and statement of points to be timely filed). However, we have adopted a more flexible approach in certain cases\\x97like this one\\x97when a rigid application of Rule 34.6 would result in denying review on the merits, even though the appellee has not established any prejudice from a slight relaxation of the rule. See, e.g., Schafer v. Conner, 813 S.W.2d 154, 155 (Tex.1991).',\n",

Then, in Gallagher v. Fire Insurance Exchange, 950 S.W.2d 370, 370-71 (Tex.1997), we reiterated our commitment to ensuring that courts do not unfairly apply the rules of appellate procedure to avoid addressing a party\\'s meritorious claim.

However, litigants should not view our relaxation of rules in a particular case as endorsing noncompliance. While we seek to resolve appeals on their merits, litigants who ignore our rules do so at the risk of forfeiting appellate relief.',\n",

Cochran does not allege that he was deprived of an opportunity to designate additional portions of the reporter's record, nor does he assert that Bennett's delay otherwise prejudiced the preparation or presentation of his case. Under these circumstances, we hold that Rule 34.6 does not preclude appellate review of Bennett's legal and factual sufficiency issues.\",\n",
